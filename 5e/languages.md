# Languages
The information on this page is 99% for flavor. A character is either proficient in a particular language or they aren't, and otherwise there's no [particular rules in 5e](https://5thsrd.org/character/languages/) D&D around languages.

Any widely-used language will develop different dialects, which are mutually intelligible: a character proficient in a dialect can understand or read any other dialect of the same language, albeit with some difficulty.

If your character has a language not listed anywhere in these tables, it's a dialect of one of the existing languages. Parenthesis are vague suggestions based on my casual poking around in the Forgotten Realms Wiki.
