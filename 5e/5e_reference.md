## Everyday problems

# What you can do during your 5th edition turn 
- Action 
- Movement
- Item interaction
- Bonus Action (if you have an ability that mentions it)
- Reaction

During [your turn](https://5thsrd.org/combat/order_of_combat/#your-turn), you have the option to [perform one](https://5thsrd.org/combat/actions_in_combat/) __action__, and you additionally have a distance of __movement__ that you may spend to move around the battlefield. Moving is not a type of action, although you may spend your action to [dash](https://5thsrd.org/combat/actions_in_combat/#dash) and double your movement for the turn. You may split up your movement before and after your action, and if you can make multiple attacks you have the option to move between each attack.

During your turn you may **manipulate one item** without spending your action: you could equip or sheath a weapon, pull a lever on the wall, ignite a torch or lantern, or retrieve your potion of healing before spending your action to drink it. If you want to manipulate more than one item you must spend your _action_. You can drop any number of items in your hands for free, but they fall on the ground and [might be damaged](#light-sources).

Some character abilities or powers mention a __bonus action__. If (and only if) you have such an ability, during your turn you may perform one such _bonus action_ alongside your regular _action_. You may perform a bonus action at any time during your turn, whether you have taken your _action_ or not. You may spend your _action_ to perform a second _bonus action_ on your turn, but not vice versa.

Finally, at the start of your turn you get a single __reaction__, which can be used at any time including other creatures' turns, until the beginning of your next turn. You spend your reaction to complete a [readied action](https://5thsrd.org/combat/actions_in_combat/#ready), to make an opportunity attack, or to cast some spells such as [_Shield_](https://5thsrd.org/spellcasting/spells/shield/).

> Creatures with **melee** attacks can spend their reaction to make an [opportunity attack](#5th-editions-simplified-opportunity-attacks). Additionally, during their turn they can spend their bonus action to [mark](#getting-marked) an opponent for later advantage on an opportunity attack.

# Ability Checks
See also my article on [5e ability checks](/5e/5e_ability_checks.md#top).

In fifth edition D&D's [bounded accuracy](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Understanding_Bounded_Accuracy_(5e_Guideline)) mathematics, these difficulty classes are universal for all power levels and situations. When thinking about a task, ask how hard it would be for a "normal human" to do, and compare with this scale:

|Ability Check DC:|5|10|15|20|25|30|
|----------------|-|--|--|--|--|--|
|Difficulty of the task:|Very Easy|Easy|Moderate|Hard|Very Hard|Nearly Impossible|


---

## Example Difficulty Classes
Here are some examples of 5e power levels in terms of _Survival_ checks to forage and successfully produce edible food, and how a character becomes capable of more and more impressive feats as they level up:
||Forest (easy)|Grasslands (moderate)|Deep Winter (hard)|Desert (very hard)|Polluted Wastelands (nearly impossible)|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Untrained (+0)|50%|1 in 4|1 in 20|impossible|impossible|
|Lvl 1 Ranger (+5)|3 out of 4|50%|1 in 4|1 in 20|impossible|
|Lvl 10 Ranger (+10)|guaranteed|3 out of 4|50%|1 in 4|1 in 20|
|Lvl 20 Ranger (+15)|guaranteed|guaranteed|3 out of 4|50%|1 in 4|

> **homebrew:** I'd probably make you fail a "guaranteed" check if you roll a natural 1, but I'm a pretty wild and crazy guy.

Similarly, here is an example of 5e's scaling on attack rolls and AC. A default +0 attack roll beats a default 10 AC eleven times out of twenty. Here are the approximate odds of doing damage for various combinations of armor class and attack bonus:
 
||Clothing (AC 10)|Chain shirt & shield (AC 15)|Full plate & shield (AC 20)|_Tarrasque_ shell (AC 25)|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Peasant (+0)|50%|1 in 4|(natural 20)|(natural 20)|
|Fighter lvl 1 (+5)|3 out of 4|50%|1 in 4|(natural 20)|
|Fighter lvl 10 (+10)|(natural 1)|3 out of 4|50%|1 in 4|
|Fighter lvl 20 (+15)|(natural 1)|(natural 1)|3 out of 4|50%|

---

# Concentration
If you take damage while maintaining _concentration_ on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of either 10 (easy) or half the damage you took, whichever is higher. If you fail the saving throw your _concentration_ is broken.

> **homebrew:** Make concentration saving throws with **Intelligence** instead of Constitution.

---

# Knocking a creature out
An attacker making a __melee__ attack that would kill a creature may choose to instead knock them out: the knocked-out creature falls unconscious, drops to 0 hitpoints, and is stable.

Most enemies don't make death saving throws and have no chance of being stabilized or saved once they go down.

> **homebrew:** IRL any blow or chemical that can render you unconscious is very close to being [strong enough to kill you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion#Treatment), and an adventurer swinging a normally-lethal weapon in the middle of adrenaline-soaked combat is in no position to carefully or safely take someone down. If you want to take a living prisoner grab some [manacles](https://5thsrd.org/adventuring/equipment/adventuring_gear/#manacles) and brush up on your [grapple rules](#getting-grappled), or play a monk.

---

# The Official 5th Edition Size Categories

**Small characters** suffer the following penalties in 5e that I know of:
- Disadvantage on attack rolls with [_heavy_ weapons](#to-swing-a-heavy-weapon).
- Penalties and a few bonuses on [special attacks](#desperate-non-weapon-attacks) such as grapple or shove when attacking bigger creatures.

---

|Size|Squares|Faer√ªn|Oerth|
|-|-|-|-|
|Gargantuan|4 by 4|20 ft|8 m|
|Huge|3 by 3|15 ft|6 m|
|Large|2 by 2|10 ft|4 m|
|Medium|1|5 ft|2 m|
|Small|1|5 ft|2 m|
|Tiny|0.5 by 0.5|2 ¬Ω ft|1 m|

>> A creature can **squeeze** through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can _squeeze_ through a passage that's only [1 square] wide.
>>
>> While _squeezing_ through a space, a creature has disadvantage on **attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws**, and [it suffers a __speed penalty__].
>>
>> Attack rolls against the creature gain advantage while it's in the smaller space. - [_Player's Handbook_](https://5thsrd.org/combat/movement_and_position/#squeezing-into-a-smaller-space)

![immovable rod](/images/immovable-rod.jpg)

## Running away from the Monsters

# Dodging
When a character uses their action to _dodge_, they gain benefits until the start of their next turn: **attacks against the dodging character** suffer disadvantage, and the character also gains advantage on **Dexterity saving throws**.

A character must be both [_able to act_ and _able to move_](#able-to-act) at the moment of the attack or saving throw in order to receive benefits from dodging.

> **homebrew:** When a creature spends its action to _dodge_ (and is receiving dodge benefits) while standing in squares containing cover, they receive the **cover bonus** from the next level of cover __above__ the actual squares' normal bonus. Thus: a square that provides half-cover for characters instead provides three-quarters cover for a dodging character, and a square that normally provides three-quarters cover can provide full cover if a character is dodging in it.

---

# 5th edition's simplified opportunity attacks
You can make an opportunity attack in the following situation (not plural):
- A hostile creature (that you can see) moves out of your **melee reach**.

You may spend your _reaction_ for the turn to make one **melee** attack against the provoking creature, right before they leave your reach.

### Disengage
If a character spends their _action_ to disengage, they don't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of their turn. Other characters may still take readied actions against a disengaging character.

---

> If you would like to take more control of the battlefield, consider _readying_ attacks and additionally the [mark bonus action](#getting-marked), which can give opportunity attacks advantage.

---

> ### Things that do not provoke opportunity attacks
> - Making a ranged attack within reach of a hostile creature causes [disadvantage](#improvised-weapons) but doesn't provoke.
> - Casting a spell with a ranged attack roll also suffers disadvantage, but otherwise spellcasting suffers no penalties.
> - You can circle around a creature without provoking as long as you stay within its reach for your entire movement.
> - There is no such thing as a [five-foot step](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:5-Foot_Step) in 5th edition.

---

# Creatures are Difficult Terrain
Creatures, including friendly creatures, are considered **difficult terrain** if you can move through their space. Generally, you can only move through the space of **nonhostile creatures**, or **creatures at least two sizes larger or smaller than you**.

You aren't allowed to end your turn occupying the same space as another creature, and a character falls [_prone_](#putting-the-crawl-in-dungeon-crawl) if they are forced into another creature's space.

---

# How to put the Crawl in [Dungeon Crawl](https://goodman-games.com/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg/)
While **prone** your only movement option is to crawl, with an additional __speed penalty__ on top of any difficult terrain. You may stand up by using **half** of your total movement speed: this ends the _prone_ condition.

Prone creatures suffer **disadvantage on attack rolls**.

An attack roll against a prone creature gains **advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet** of the creature, but if the attacker is farther away their attack roll suffers disadvantage instead.

> **homebrew:** _prone_ creatures who don't move gain advantage on their **ranged attack rolls**.
>
> When _Prone_ creatures who are [_able to move_](#able-to-move) are in squares containing cover, they get the same (non-stacking) homebrew bonus for [taking the Dodge action in cover](#dodging).

![immovable rod](/images/immovable-rod.jpg)

## Hiding from the Monsters

# Creatures Provide Cover
Creatures, including friendly creatures, provide **half cover** (+2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws) to targets.

If a cover bonus causes an attack to miss when it would otherwise hit, the attack hits the cover instead.

---

# Stealth
**You must normally be _highly obscured_ to attempt to hide.** WotC seems reluctant to explicitly state this rule, preferring to just say "ask your DM" instead, but here are some official [exceptions that prove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_that_proves_the_rule#Proving_the_existence_of_the_rule) you can't normally hide while only lightly obscured or behind cover:

> **Character Bonus:** A **Wood Elf** character's _Mask of the Wild_ feature allows them to try to hide while only _lightly obscured_ by foliage, weather, or other natural phenomena.

> **Character Bonus:** A character with the **Skulker** feat can attempt to hide while only _lightly obscured_.

> **Character Bonus:** A **Lightfoot Halfling** character's _Naturally Stealthy_ feature allows them to try to hide while obscured by a Medium or larger creature (normally half cover but no obscurity). 

See Appendix B [official rules quotes](#appendix-b-official-rules-quotes)

---

I would adjudicate that you must be __highly obscured__ to take the hide action, which requires you to roll a __Dexterity__ (_Stealth_) check:
- While you stay highly obscured creatures have [no chance to perceive you](#cover-and-obscurity) even when you're not trying to hide, so your check result is irrelevant.
- If you move out of the highly obscured area, you're [invisible](https://5thsrd.org/rules/conditions/#invisible) to creatures with a passive __Wisdom__ (_Perception_) score less than your check result.
   - Any creature may spend their action on their turn to [search](https://5thsrd.org/combat/actions_in_combat/#search) and make an active Wisdom (_Perception_) check to find hidden characters.
   - Wisdom (_Perception_) checks suffer disadvantage when looking into **lightly obscured** areas (including all [dim light and darkvision](#light-and-vision)), and creatures' passive Perception scores suffer a -5 penalty.

Attacking, casting a spell, and many other actions will end your current hide attempt.

---

# Melee attacks can be affected by cover in the same way as ranged attacks
Don't let those silly barbarians and paladins rush your archers!

---

# Cover and Obscurity

Cover:
- Creatures with either half or three-quarters cover receive a fixed bonus to their **Armor Class and their Dexterity saving throws**.
- A creature with **full cover** can't be individually targeted, and to be affected by an area of effect the spell or effect must be able to get past the obstacle.

Obscurity:
- **Wisdom (_Perception_) checks** based on sight suffer disadvantage when their targets are **lightly obscured**.
- Creatures are effectively __blinded__ when trying to see into **heavily obscured** areas: they automatically fail any ability check that depends on sight, they suffer disadvantage on all attack rolls into the area, and anyone firing back at them (without also being _blinded_ by whatever is obscuring them) has advantage on attack rolls.
  - When someone fires out of heavy obscurity they normally reveal the square they're firing from, but they're still __invisible__ to their effectively-blinded target.

For terrain such as walls and windows, the maximum obscurity assumes the character is **actively (and successfully)** trying to use the terrain to hide. Likewise the cover assumes the character is actively staying down among the features of the terrain. In both cases a character must be [_able to move_](#able-to-move).

## Examples of Cover
||No Cover|Half Cover (+2)|Three-Quarters Cover (+5)|Full Cover|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Not Obscured**|                                                                                                                      __Bright light__ or __sunlight__.               |                    A shield. Studded leather or hide armor.            |            Half plate or chainmail armor.             |            A _Wall of Force_. Bulletproof glass.                                                |
|**Lightly Obscured**|                                                                                           **Dim light**. **Rain**. **Foliage**. Things seen only with darkvision.

A **large window** or a damaged small window. A wall destroyed by a seige weapon.               |                A [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisade) **palisade**. An **ancient wall** ruined by erosion. Magically-reinforced smoked [glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Rupert%27s_drop).           |           A [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlement) **battlement**. A [tower shield](https://roll20.net/compendium/pathfinder/Shield,%20Tower#content).|
|**Heavily Obscured**|                                                                                                 **Darkness**. **Fog**. **Smoke**. An opaque curtain.         |         A **small window**. A [sudare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudare) or thin wall. A [porti√®re](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porti%C3%A8re) or heavy curtain such as in a [theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theater_drapes_and_stage_curtains).         |         A **wooden wall**.

[_Mislead_](https://5thsrd.org/spellcasting/spells/mislead/) `5`. |

> The _Mold Earth_ cantrip in _Xanathar's Guide_ "doesn't involve enough force to cause damage", therefore it can't be used to build terrain better than half-cover and light obscurity. 
> 
> **homebrew:** Repeatedly casting _Mold Earth_ to build up fortifications in a wide area requires **four times** as much time to complete as compared with casting the 4th-level _Stone Shape_ as a __ritual__ in order to build the same volume of fortification up to three-quarters cover and heavy obscurity.

# Light and Vision

|_light_|Direct Sunlight|Bright Light|Dim Light|Darkness|Magical Darkness|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|__*effect*__|Drow Elves, Kobolds, and undead suffer various disadvantages.|-|__Lightly Obscured__|_Lightly Obscured_ with darkvision. __Heavily Obscured__ and _Blinded_ without darkvision, blindsight, or truesight.|_Blinded_ without devilsight, blindsight, or truesight.|

>> _Things seen using **darkvision** are considered to be in **dim light**, and are therefore **lightly obscured**._ - Player's Handbook

Most Darkvision is grayscale colorblind.

A creature with Blindsight doesn't need vision to perceive their surroundings, and (presumably) can't be _Blinded_.

A creature with Truesight can see though magical and nonmagical darkness, illusions, shapechangers, and into the ethereal plane.

Most Devilsight (at least the kind _Monster Manual_ devils possess) only ignores magical darkness, not natural. 

> **Character Bonus:** The **Warlock** eldritch invocation _Devil's Sight_ is a special case that ignores both.

> ~~**Character Bonus?!?**~~ **Drow Elves**, **Kobolds**, and **undead creatures** suffer various disadvantages in direct _sunlight_, most commonly:
>> Disadvantage on attack rolls and **Wisdom** (_Perception_) ability checks if either the creature or the target they're looking at are in _sunlight_.

## Getting killed by the monsters

# Running Out of Ammo
After combat a character may spend a minute and recover up to **half** of the ammunition they expended during the combat.

> __homebrew__: Roll a d100 and recover that % of your expended ammunition instead.

---

# Unarmed Strikes
Unless you have special abilities or features, attacking without a weapon deals bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier plus 1. You are proficient in your unarmed strikes.

> __homebrew:__ Most characters are not proficient with unarmed strikes by default. A character with a Strength penalty must succeed on an easy [DC 10] Strength check to deal 1 point of damage on a successful hit.

---

# Improvised Weapons
An improvised weapon that doesn't resemble a normal weapon deals 1d4 damage and has a throwing range of 20/60 ft. You don't get your proficiency bonus on attack rolls with such weapons.

> **Using a ranged weapon to make a melee attack** is treated like wielding an improvised weapon, as does **throwing a melee weapon not designed to be thrown**.
> 
>  In contrast, making a **ranged attack while a hostile creature is within 5 ft** gives you disadvantage instead.

> **Character Bonus:** Characters with the **_Tavern Brawler_** feat get their proficiency bonus with all improvised and unarmed attacks. After hitting a creature with either kind of attack, a **_Tavern Brawler_** may then spend their _bonus action_ to immediately make a [grapple attempt](#desperate-non-weapon-attacks) on the creature.

---

# Getting _grappled_
While you are holding a creature in the _grappled_ condition that creature has a movement speed of 0, but you can both freely take actions.

On your turn you can move while dragging or carrying your grappled target along with you by spending double movement. If the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you it doesn't cost extra movement to carry.

In order to escape, the grappled creature must spend their action to repeat the contested ability check, and unless they beat you they remain grappled. They are free to take other actions instead of escaping but cannot move.

You can release your grappled target whenever you like without an action. If you become [_unable to act_](#able-to-act) your target is freed, as well as if an effect moves or forces them to a location outside your reach.

> **Character Bonus:** A character with the **Grappler** feat (needs Str 13) gets advantage on on attack rolls against their _grappled_ target. They may spend their _action_ to attempt another grapple check vs their _grappled_ target, and on a success both the character and their target are _restrained_ until the grapple ends. 


---

# Getting _marked_

When you make a melee attack you may spend your _bonus action_ for the turn to __mark__ your target.

Until the end of your next turn, any [opportunity attack](#5th-editions-simplified-opportunity-attacks) you make against the marked target has advantage.

If you do end up making an opportunity attack against your marked target, you may take one additional _reaction_ before your next turn, but not another opportunity attack.

> *The mark bonus action is an optional rule from the DMG*

---

# Desperate Non-Weapon Attacks
Grapple, shove, and many other special combat attacks are resolved with contested ability checks. The table below summarizes the details of these attacks. All of these attacks are melee attacks and require you to be within reach of your target.

Some of these special attacks are performed using the Attack action, and if you can make multiple attacks the special attack replaces one of them.

|Attack|Valid Target Sizes|Attacker Check|Defender Check|Action|Effect|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Grapple|A creature up to **one size larger** than you.|Str (Ath)|Str (Ath) or Dex (Acr)|Attack| Target becomes _grappled_.|
|Shove|A creature up to one size larger than you.|Str (Ath)|Str (Ath) or Dex (Acr)|Attack| You choose whether the target falls prone or is pushed 5 ft.|
|Shove Aside|A creature up to one size larger than you.|Str (Ath) **with disadv**|Str (Ath) or Dex (Acr)|Attack| Move the target 5 ft to a space within your reach.|
|Disarm|You suffer disadv if the target is holding their weapon with 2+ hands. Target gets adv if larger than you, or disadv if smaller.|**Attack roll**|Str (Ath) or Dex (Acr)|Attack| Target drops their weapon.|
|Overrun|You get adv if larger than your target, disadv if smaller.|Str (Ath)|**Str (Ath)**|Bonus Action| You can move through the target's space once this turn.
|Tumble|_homebrew: you get adv if smaller than your target_|**Dex (Acr)**|**Dex (Acr)**|Bonus Action| You can move through the target's space once this turn.|
|Climb Onto|A creature at least **two sizes larger** than you.|**Str (Ath) or Dex (Acr)**|**Dex (Acr)**|Action, then Movement| The target is treated as (difficult) terrain. You get advantage on attacks against the target.|
|Dislodge|A smaller creature climbing on you.|Str (Ath)|Str (Ath) or Dex (Acr)|Action| The climber is knocked off you.|

> **homebrew:** if you wish to throw a Gnome or similarly-sized creature at an enemy, you give advantage to the Gnome's Climb Onto attempt or one weapon attack against that enemy, using your Strength bonus and improvised weapon proficiency. If the Gnome isn't cooperating with you to attack then what you are _actually_ doing instead is attempting to either Grapple or Shove that poor Gnome.

## Strange Situations

# Riding a mount
Once during a character's movement for a turn, they can mount or dismount a creature within 1 square of them. Doing so costs __half__ the character's movement speed.

If their mount is knocked prone, a rider can use their _reaction_ to dismount and land on their feet. Otherwise, the rider is dismounted and falls prone in an adjacent square.

If a rider is knocked prone, or their mount is moved against its will, the rider must succeed on an Easy difficulty Dexterity saving throw `DC 10`, or else they dismount and fall prone in an adjacent square.

> If a mount provokes an **opportunity attack**, the attacker may optionally choose to target the rider instead.

## Independent mounts
An intelligent mount, or one the rider is not controlling, retains its own initiative count and has no restrictions on its movement or actions.

## Controlling a mount
A mount the rider is controlling acts on the rider's initiative, including on the turn the rider mounted it. The mount has full movement speed but can only take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions. The rider may spend their action to try to make the mount Attack.

# Underwater combat
Creatures and objects immersed in water have resistance to all fire damage.

Any creature with a _swimming_ movement speed can use melee weapons freely underwater. For other creatures, a __melee weapon__ attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.

A __ranged weapon__ attack automatically misses if the target is at long range underwater, and even at normal range the attack roll has disadvantage, unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a thrown weapon including a javelin, spear, trident, or dart.

## Appendix A: Homebrew Definitions

# Able to Act
> **homebrew definition:** Creatures that aren't [_incapacitated_](https://5thsrd.org/rules/conditions/#incapacitated) are **able to act**.

---

# Able to Move
> **homebrew definition:** Creatures that aren't _immobile_ are **able to move**.
>
> Creatures are __immobile__ if their speed is `0` or any effect is preventing them from moving, including: being grappled, paralyzed, petrified, stunned, or unconscious.

---

# Evade

> **homebrew definition:** To *evade* means "take no damage on any successful Dexterity saving throw, or half damage on a failed save".

---

# Movement _Speed Penalties_
>> Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain. - [Difficult Terrain](https://5thsrd.org/combat/movement_and_position/#difficult-terrain)
>>
>> Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement. - [Being Prone](https://5thsrd.org/combat/movement_and_position/#being-prone)
>>
>> A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. - [_Plant Growth_](https://5thsrd.org/spellcasting/spells/plant_growth/)

When you put these rules side-by-side, you can see how they allow stacking penalties without [exponential growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth). Still, I think the language is a little clunky, so here's my alternative take:

> **homebrew:** A character may suffer one or more **speed penalties** from effects such as _difficult terrain_, being forced to crawl while _prone_, or three _speed penalties_ from [_Plant Growth_](https://5thsrd.org/spellcasting/spells/plant_growth/).
>
> To move one square on the battlegrid, a character must expend squares from their movement equal to [1 + their current number of _speed penalties_].
> 
> Likewise, moving one meter, foot, or any other unit, requires movement equal to the same unit multiplied by [1 + their current number of _speed penalties_].

![immovable rod](/images/immovable-rod.jpg)

## Appendix B: official rules quotes

# Stealth

Player's Handbook page 177 (stealth inset) and 291 (invisible condition):

> You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase. An **invisible creature** can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.
>
> An **invisible** creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is **heavily obscured**. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.



# Official spellcasting somatic rules

Characters who wish to cast spells must have one hand free to either use a _component pouch_ or an appropriate [_spellcasting focus_](https://5thsrd.org/adventuring/equipment/adventuring_gear/#arcane-focus) for their class. They may make any somatic spell components needed for the spell using the same hand that is holding the focus or material component.

> An **arcane caster** who uses a _staff_ as a spellcasting focus, or a **druid** using a _wooden staff_, can also use it as a _quarterstaff_ to make melee weapon attacks.

> **Divine spellcasters** may use an _emblem_ of their deity emblazoned on their shield as a spellcasting focus, but they risk being unable to cast spells if they aren't using the shield. They may also use an amulet as a focus, but still need a hand free to use it.
