# The Subtle Elegance of Fifth Edition D&D Ability Checks
When designing 5th edition, the team at WotC set out to change course from some philosophical decisions of 4th edition that many people felt led 4e astray. One major concern was making it feel more like "plain old D&D", as 4e had traded in the vast undefined spaces of prior D&D editions of rules in favor of a tightly-controlled and carefully-balanced mathematical rule system.

To accomplish this goal, the 5e team developed a system with a new abstract mathematical core, which they called [bounded accuracy](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Understanding_Bounded_Accuracy_(5e_Guideline)), and then built a minimal set of vanilla rules on top of that core that makes it feel much like older editions for existing players. Thus, 5e has been called ["everybody's second-favorite edition"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/3nnjsr/why_is_dd_5e_everybodys_second_favorite_edition/), because players from any previous edition can quickly pick up 5e, learn about the new _advantage_ rule and the truncated skill list, and keep playing D&D in essentially the same way they always have.

These predictable vanilla rules, however, form a _Nystul's Magic Aura_ that disguises the elegance and power of the new mathematics. By taking apart 5e's abstract core check mechanics and understanding them, DMs can accomplish much more than just playing "plain old D&D".

## Checks and Bonuses
If third edition D&D was "the d20 system", then fifth edition D&D is the 3d20 system, with the entire system orbiting around three core rolls:

|Check|Sum|
|-|-|
|Ability Check|d20 roll + Ability Bonus + Skill or Tool Proficiency + Background Modifiers|
|Saving Throw|d20 roll + Ability Bonus + Saving Throw Proficiency + Background Modifiers|
|Attack Roll|d20 roll + Ability Bonus + Weapon Proficiency + Background Modifiers|

A first observation we might make is that the different proficiencies are essentially the same bonus, and therefore all three rolls could be combined into a single Ability Check. Examining the [5th edition conditions](https://5thsrd.org/rules/conditions/) shows one reason why WotC broke them out: different conditions affect ability checks vs saving throws vs attack rolls. The vanilla penalties for levels of _exhaustion_, for example, first affect the "less important" ability checks before they affect attack rolls and saving throws. The 5e _charmed_ condition gives disadvantage to ability checks but isn't powerful enough to affect weapon attacks or saving throws. Even if your campaign avoids combat, you might think of similar attack-defense-neutral categories, or "anxious" vs "relaxed" checks, that are relevant to your campaign's ability checks.

## There Are Four Lights
A second thing to observe is that this does indeed look like older editions of D&D. At least since third edition (my personal first D&D), it's been standard to think of ability checks, attack rolls, and even saving throws as a stack of +2s, -5s, and other numerical modifiers representing the local situation. The checks of fifth edition, however, have gathered all of these into **four specific modifiers** with subtly different rules based on their different purposes:

|Modifier|Responsibility|Description|
|-|-|-|
|Ability Bonus|Player|How a character does things, such as whether they _Intimidate_ more using the subtle blackmail of Charisma or the obvious threat of Strength. Generally represents personality and natural talents more than training.|
|Proficiency Bonus|Player|Tasks that involve multiple abilities or require special training, such as _Surviving_ in the wild, using _blacksmithing tools_, and being _proficient_ with a bastard sword.|
|Advantage and Disadvantage|DM|Temporary and round-to-round factors.|
|Background Modifiers|DM|Stacking +5 and -5 modifiers that rarely change, such as "all characters have a +5 cover bonus to AC while standing in this area."|

## Taking Advantage of the Rules
One quick note about advantage: although advantage is generally considered to be about [a +5 bonus "where it counts"](http://rolesrules.blogspot.com/2012/05/d-next-disadvantage.html), unlike numerical modifiers advantage and disadvantage have the important property that they _never allow players to roll above a 20 or below a 1_. Because of this, advantage and disadvantage can be given to any roll without worrying about it stacking with other modifiers and making absurd results possible. Even if you homebrew to allow multiple stacking advantages, or figure out some way to make both advantage and disadvantage apply at the same time, the roll can never break out of the standard 1 to 20 range.

This means that handing out advantage and disadvantage is an extremely **safe** way to improv situational advantages. Never feel hesitation in handing out advantage or disadvantage as a DM: they're 5e's most important new rule precisely because they're incapable of breaking 5e's mathematical core.

## Investigating 5th Edition Skills
By default, and in accordance with previous editions, vanilla 5e ties each _skill or tool proficiency_ to a particular ability score. Page 155 of the 5e _Player's Handbook_ has a "variant" rule for combining different ability scores with different proficiencies, and previous editions have at least hinted at this idea. As I suspect a lot of people have done, for a long time I thought this sounded like a cool idea but didn't have a lot of ideas for non-vanilla checks.

Fifth edition plants the seeds of an advancement that I think will be everywhere in D&D a decade from now, however, by squeezing all of the _proficiency bonuses_ into a single simple binary of "proficient/not proficient in this task" and a level-based bonus. As a result, a Dexterity check to disarm a trap could potentially be adjudicated as taking their proficiency from _Sleight of Hand_, _thieves' tools_, their _Criminal_ background, or any number of other places. The **proficiency** side of the 5e ability check has an infinite number of options to fill in the binary "proficient", but the single level-based bonus prevents this from becoming a tedious task of having to select among infinite minor +2 and +3 bonuses. The remaining innovation needed is simply to loosen up the other fifth edition modifier available to players, their **ability bonus**, and give them a second, similar yet distinct, choice to made for each ability check from among their character's six classic ability scores. When you do that, very exciting things will begin to happen.

Today, I'm here to tell you to **take that variant skill ability rule and run with it, into every wall and off the edge of every cliff**. Every DM and every player of _any_ edition of D&D should start thinking of _every_ skill or proficiency bonus as being usable with _any_ ability score. To show you what I mean, check out this example of a new 5e skill, called _Riding_, that I created for use in the dinosaur races of my Tomb of Annihilation campaign:

![immovable rod](/images/immovable-rod.jpg)

##### New Skill Proficiency: 
# _**Riding**_
#### Commonly Dexterity
Riding a dinosaur at top speed, in the midst of dozens of other huge beasts in what is essentially a stampede, is a far more physical and strenuous activity than simply "handling" one. The dinosaur racers of Port Nyanzaru use a new skill proficiency available to characters called _**Riding**_. A character's _Riding_ proficiency is commonly applied to a **Dexterity** check, but racing involves all of a character's abilities at one point or another.

> **Character Bonus:** During character creation any character who is, or has the option to be, proficient in _Animal Handling_ may select _Riding_ to replace one of their skill proficiencies.
 
|Ability|Two Example Tasks|
|-|-|
|Strength|Pull the reins on a massive triceratops. Dig your heels into a dinosaur's thick feathers and hide.|
|**Dexterity**|**Dodge swinging tails and horns. Direct your mount with the reins.**|
|Constitution|Endure a strike by a dinosaur limb. Endure the rough ride, noise, smell, dust, and kicked-up debris of a race.|
|Intelligence|Predict that your mount will be spooked by something up ahead. Diagnose and treat a dinosaur when it's unhealthy.|
|Wisdom|Notice a subtle change in the stampede around you. Notice when a dinosaur or rider is hurt or becoming tired.|
|Charisma|Impress the crowd. Get a favor from another rider.|

Similarly to tools, characters are separately proficient with different species of rideable mount.

When managing a mount in combat, a character may use their proficiency bonus if they are _proficient_ in either _Riding_ or _Animal Handling_.

## Multiball
The above mostly-flavor text is all you need to create a skill in 5e, and that twelve-entry table of Ability score example tasks is all you need to unlock the power of the "variant" skill proficiency rule for any edition of D&D.

By allowing players to mix-and-match ability scores with proficiencies, instead of skills being a list of about a dozen _additional_ check possibilities on top of a character's basic abilities, we now get to __multiply__ our proficiencies' use with the six classic D&D ability scores, and can create and improv vastly more possibilities. If you can get your players on board, the any-ability-any-proficiency framework lets them use more of their characters' abilities more often, and come up with more ideas for how to justify and use their characters' unique bonuses and proficiencies.

After creating my first few new skills for my ToA campaign using this method, I typed up a list of every 5e skill proficiency and started filling each one out with a similar table of two sample tasks for each ability score. I highly recommend doing something similar: grab 5e's minimal skill list, add whatever you feel is missing, and try to brainstorm a use for each skill with each of the six abilities. Then, make a second pass and try to come up with a second example task for each combination. It's a fun improv exercise, and as a surprising bonus I have finally answered the question "wtf is Charisma" to my own satisfaction.

## But That Sounds Hard
Just in case you missed it, **none** of the twelve tasks I listed for _Riding_ have example DCs. In contrast to 3e, as the DM I will **never** have to fill out lists of 5e example DCs, nor will I have to come up with a scale for how a proficiency bonus levels up. Fifth edition's bounded-accuracy design means that _every_ DC, regardless of ability, proficiency, or character power level, is anchored around a standard set of six named difficulties:

|Check DC:|5|10|15|20|25|30|
|----------------|-|--|--|--|--|--|
|Difficulty of the task:|Very Easy|Easy|Moderate|Hard|Very Hard|Nearly Impossible|

By keeping this simple scale in the back of my mind as a DM, I can quickly improvise **any** ability check with any proficiency, depending either on if I _feel_ the simulated task would be "hard" in real life, or just based on the in-game difficulty I want to enforce for the mechanical task. I can still pick a 13 or 17 if that _feels_ right, but the standard levels being 5 points away from each other means each separate level feels significant.

Additionally, by verbally using these names of **easy, moderate, hard,** etc difficulties with my players, I'm letting them know how I decided the DC for the task they asked about, and I'm offering them an opportunity to argue for a higher or lower difficulty instead. And since the levels are separated by 5, we're not arguing about tweaking minor +1 or -2 modifiers. Almost all numeric modifiers to 5e checks are a +5 or a -5, except the character's ability and proficiency bonuses, which the player gets to __play__ with and maximize using narrative improv and finding an applicable ability + proficiency combination.

## The Elephant in the Background
Black lives matter, and black people shouldn't have to live in fear of being violently attacked by american police.

We finally come to the last category of modifier: _background modifiers_. Unlike the three other modifiers in fifth edition, the background modifiers for a particular check are a potentially-infinite list of generally +5 and -5 modifiers that mostly don't change very much. The most common example in vanilla 5e is [cover](): it provides a fixed bonus of either +2 or +5 to the target's armor class, and cover is commonly described as the one exception to advantage and disadvantage replacing all other vanilla 5e modifiers.

Suppose you've prepared a battlefield where a band of kobolds are behind a wall that provides 3/4 cover and thus a +5 AC bonus. It should be obvious and easy for both you and your players to remember that any creature standing in the squares containing the wall gets the cover bonus, while they lose it if they move away. Since cover _isn't_ an advantage/disadvantage modifier, you can still use that tool separately to improv turn-by-turn factors. If a player asks to spend one turn taking aim to improve their odds of beating the cover, or comes up with an idea based on their character history of how to provoke the kobolds out of position, you can easily let them have _advantage_ on their next turn without worrying about how it will interact with cover or other background modifiers. Additionally, although background modifiers should mostly be _rarely changing_, it's no trouble at all to improv the cover being destroyed.

## Quite a Vorpal Sword
Thus, instead of dozens of changing +1s and -2s modifiers to keep track of, 5th edition D&D has carefully divided its check bonuses and penalties into four specific modifiers, with separate rules depending on their particular purposes. By combining _background modifiers_ to set up permanent, rarely-changing effects, with the safe improv tools of _advantage_ and _disadvantage_, and with the third dimension of a universal and fixed DC scale, you can construct a powerful and flexible framework to DM and adjudicate ability and skill checks for any situation in any edition of D&D. And by letting players multiply their characters' _skill and tool proficiencies_ with the classic six ability scores, you give them many more options to play with as well.

When you combine the six standard difficulty levels of fifth edition with the four modifiers (**advantage, ability bonus, proficiency bonus, background modifiers**) that apply to all three core rolls (**attack, saving throw, ability check**), you get an elegant, multidimensional, and extremely flexible system that both the DM and the players can improv within:
- **The players** get to figure out and improv their character's best ability bonus and proficiency combination, and can understand and argue back about task DCs as well as asking for _advantage_.
- **The DM** gets the easy and safe improv tools of _advantage_ and _disadvantage_, and can also prepare stacking +5 and -5 _background modifiers_ that don't need to be constantly recalculated.

Just in case you haven't realized it yet, 5th edition D&D is _**very**_ cool, and there's something special hidden behind that  _Nystul's Magic Aura_.
