# Welcome to _**The Adventurer's League!**_

Welcome, adventurer! _**The Adventurer's League**_ is a great place to meet other players of _Dungeon's & Dragons_, and a reliable way to play the game, something that can be hard to find. I've had a blast with my time at my local weekly games, and I hope in the coming months you'll enjoy similarly awesome times.

When playing D&D in the Adventurer's League, characters commonly float from Dungeon Master to Dungeon Master, adventure to adventure, each and every session. Similar to the crews in the ancient _Star Trek_ myths, the party's characters come together and struggle solve a problem, but by next week they'll be cleaned up, fixed up, and meeting strange new people in a strange new land unlike anywhere they've been before. An unspecified amount of time passes between each adventure, and although the League awards specific amounts of _downtime days_ each session, this is only the small number of productive days a character has while travelling and searching for their next job.

Because of the vast differences between each individual Dungeon Master's different style of running adventures, when you take your character together into a larger event such as a con or major release, everyone's characters get smoothed out and synced up to a specific power level of wealth and items based on seniority (the more the character is played, the more they level up). This smooths out the problems that can occur if I accidentally bring my character _Grandor Pelorson_ from the high-fantasy pillage-loot-and-carouse adventures run by my local dungeon master Doug, to the same session where you bring your character _Bob Twelve-and-a-Half_, the only character of yours that has survived the meat-grinder adventures run by your local dungeon master Acererak. It also smooths out similar issues when jumping between weekly oneshots at your local _Adventurer's League_ wednesday night games.

Anyways, please keep all that in mind when you look at [_The Adventurer's League Player's Guide_](https://media.wizards.com/2020/dnd/downloads/ALPGv92.pdf) and the associated rules for characters being used for play in the Adventurer's League. In our weekly games we don't have to be super strict about always tiptoeing around the League's guidelines as if they were policed regulations, or always make jokes about how the gold isn't real. Especially if you're coming back to the same table over and over again each week, we can play Adventurer's League D&D pretty much like how we play any of our D&D games. And fifth edition D&D is a flexible minimal foundation that can built upon with homebrew to create D&D games that feel like any or all of the previous editions, or your own personal edition, and [it has a few neat tricks up its sleeve once you take it seriously](5e_ability_checks.md#top).

Thank you for reading, and I hope you have fun with all of us playing together in **_The Adventurer's League!_**
