  72: > Camping does not replace and only occasionally overlaps with _Wilderness Survival_: _Wilderness Survival_ is about **safely** travelling through the wilderness and avoiding the many dangers and risks found in the wild; _Camping_ is about maintaining creature comforts and making a campsite more comfortable for the party to rest. The knowledge from _Wilderness Survival_ (or _Nature_) can sometimes provide an advantage on a camping task, but neither includes the specific practical knowledge of _Camping_.
