# The Incredible Power in the Nine Sublime Pages of _Player's Handbook_ Chapter Eight
Believe me: there's more than one hidden gem within the **seven** pages of rules and **two** full-page illustrations of the 5th edition _Player's Handbook_ **Chapter 8: Adventuring**. If you're a DM, they can give you more magical power than all 91 pages of _Part 3: The Rules of Magic_ will ever give your players' spellcasters.

Chapter eight has several extremely-simple but subtly important rules:
- Adventuring (noncombat) movement speed
- Short rests
- Long rests
- Downtime days
- Living expenses

Each of these **_activities_** has some minimal rules in vanilla 5th edition that tightly integrate them into the "core" D&D game, which has rules for a variety of situations but is most heavily built out for **combat**. The short and long rests are key to recovering after combat, and a long rest also usually happens once each adventuring day. The minimal sample rules for downtime days, lifestyle expenses, and noncombat movement speed likewise have ideas for how those things can provide combat-related benefits or effects.

## Days of Our Lives
Notice what all these activities have in common: they're all related to the rhythm of **a character's life**, and in particular their life _outside of combat_. D&D's robust combat rules, by way of contrast, offer plenty of opportunities for DMs and players to be creative and improvise, but they would never offer the suggestion that you should try altering the six-second round or recreating the initiative order so that some players take twice as many turns as others get. The minimal framework in chapter eight, however, is so bare-bones that a DM basically _has to_ establish that kind of foundation to begin taking advantage of these rules.

Stop and think about how D&D combat is generally described as taking a few dozen seconds to complete, up to a few minutes at maximum, and contrast that with all the soft theater "roleplaying" parts that most people love about D&D. Now add back in all the "missing scenes" that your group of players usually skips over because they would be boring. The noncombat "adventuring" part of D&D, which has generally been _underspecified_ in the core rules, turns out to be... almost the entire lives of the characters, and the bulk of the stories we care about.

## Time is a Flat Circle
Instead of thinking of these chapter eight _activities_ simply as 5e's bare-bones substitute for the richer rules from _[your preferred D&D edition]_, think of them as abstract **bracketed improv spaces**: places for not only the theater-style roleplaying that most people associate with the word "improv", but _also_ for empowering DMs to build _**campaign-specific rules systems**_ and then improv rulings on top of them to create wildly better games, in the original style of Gary Gygax himself.

To use the activities in chapter eight, you arrange them into campaign-specific **loops** which establish the foundation needed to use the full power of these ideas. Fifth edition comes with the "default" loop of adventuring and combat: wake up from your long rest, fight some combats, make some ability checks, potentially take some short rests, then finish and restart the loop with the next long rest. In contrast, creating your own campaign-specific loops enables you to flesh out the rules and structure of the noncombat parts of D&D that are often left to languish.

To show you what I mean, I've come up with four quick ideas of how a DM could build completely different campaigns, loops, and rulesets around the core ideas in chapter eight:

# Welcome to the Jungle
My original experience with chapter eight came when I started working on notes to run _Tomb of Annihilation_, and ended up developing homebrew rules for a brutal slog through the jungle. This ToA loop is a model of what the party is often doing in D&D between their home base and the dungeon, even if plenty of D&D campaigns are happy to quietly skip over all the travel and random encounter parts.

Daily Loop:
- Morning **downtime activity** or **short rest** activity (each player chooses and rolls 1 ability check)
- Morning **travel** on the Chult hex map based on the party's **noncombat movement speed** (1 Wisdom (Survival) check from 1 or 2 players)
- Morning random encounter (0 or 1 encounter)
- **Short rest** and activity (each player chooses and rolls 1 ability check)
- Afternoon **travel** (1 Wisdom (Survival) check from 1 or 2 players)
- Afternoon random encounter (0 or 1 encounter)
- Evening **downtime activity** or **short rest** activity (each player chooses and rolls 1 ability check)
- Night watch random encounter (0 or 1 combat started by 1 Wisdom (Perception) check from 1 or 2 players)
- **Long rest** is complete at dawn, restart with morning activities.

|Bracketed Improv Space|Use|
|-|-|
|Downtime days|Days spent out of the jungle getting supplies in the main city Port Nyanzaru.|
|Living expenses|Simple flavor of which Port Nyanzaru district you're staying in.|
|Noncombat movement speed|The ToA rules for getting lost in the jungle, and chapter eight's vanilla fast-and-slow-pace rules.|
|Long rests|Rules for camping in the jungle and preparing for the night's potential encounter, then surviving it.|
|Short rests|Activities for "generic" things D&D characters do to clean up: polish armor, chat, drink a beer, etc.| 
|"Core" game structure|D&D rules for going into dungeons and getting into fights.|

# The Aristocrats
The party plays a social circle of aristocrats who spend their nights partying and their mornings-after gossiping.

Daily Loop:
- Spend the morning on a practical **downtime activity** such as shopping or managing your household.
- Brunch is a **short rest** activity to gossip and recover.
- Spend the afternoon on another practical activity, or go to your first social **activity** visiting at a friends' house.
- Supper is another **short rest** activity.
- Going to your first party of the evening is chosen like a **downtime activity** and involves your **lifestyle** and **noncombat movement speed** to determine if you are forced to arrive more-than-fashionably-late.
- Actually attending the party becomes the **core game** instead of D&D's combat (which still breaks out occasionally).
- You can potentially try to stay out late and go to multiple parties, but suffer more and more disadvantages the further you push on.
- To begin the night's **long rest** activities, decide who you're going home with and just what, exactly, you intend to do to them.
- In the morning your **long rest** completes and you review how your night went. Did you actually get any rest?
- Breakfast is a **short rest** of drinking coffee or sobering up in case characters need it, then the party starts the next campaign day.

|Bracketed Improv Space|Use|
|-|-|
|Downtime days|Practical activities during the day, followed by a round of going to parties in the evening.|
|Long rests|Who are you going home with tonight, and just what are you going to do with them? And once you reach the morning, how well did the night go, and did you actually get any rest?|
|Short rests|Brunching or snacking with others between activities or parties.|
|Living expenses|Could become a complicated system about living in fashionable districts and near the hottest parties, faking appearances when you're running out of money, etc.|
|Noncombat movement speed|Getting across the city from your living space to the hottest party in a rented car vs walking vs a horse.|
|"Core" game structure|Rules for hosting and attending parties, based on D&D ability and skill checks. Combat occasionally occurs as a duel or other social fight.|

# We Are Legend
In an [_Omega Man_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Omega_Man)-style post-apocalyptic world ruled by vampires and undead, one surviving party of vampire hunters must survive each night, spending the precious daylight hours preparing for the night's attacks.

Loop:
- The morning sun has come to vanquish the horrible night, and you complete your **long rest**.
- Morning **downtime activity** to either clean up after last night's attack, or to travel looking for supplies. Potential noncombat **random encounter**.
- **Short rest** at noon, with different activities for travelling vs staying at headquarters.
- Separate afternoon **downtime activities** depending on where each character is. Another potential noncombat **random encounter**.
- One final evening **downtime activity**, or a **short rest**, after everyone gets back home.
- **Core game:** Survive D&D combat until morning.

|Bracketed Improv Space|Use|
|-|-|
|Downtime days|Spending the daylight hours preparing for vampire hunts, and making journeys to find info.|
|Long rests|Retreat to your headquarters and survive the night's attacks.|
|Living expenses|The party must collectively pay for and manage features of their headquarters.|
|Noncombat movement speed|Determines how far you can safely explore each day. Find and repair an old car or bus to extend your range. Risk getting stuck outside after sundown and having to hunker down.|
|"Core" game structure|D&D combat rules.|

# The Rogues' Gallery
The classic D&D idea of a party full of rogues, pulling off heists in a fantasy metropolis.

Loop:
- Nightfall ends your long rest, and provides your first opportunity for a downtime **activity** to perform petty crimes or prepare for a heist.
- A **short rest** at midnight.
- Late night **activities** are usually the right time to try to pull off a heist, which is the core game of the campaign.
- The beginning of the **long rest** during daylight hours is making your escape back to your hideout without being followed. The crimes you pulled off in the night determine how hard that is, as do your **lifestyle expenses** and **noncombat movement speed**.

|Space|Use|
|-|-|
|Downtime "days"|Committing or preparing for crimes each night|
|Long rest|Flee the crime scene, possibly under pursuit, then spend the day recovering. Maybe the party needs to find a shady doctor willing to quietly pull that incriminating arrow out of your knee.|
|Noncombat movement speed|The getaway car and driver.|
|Lifestyle expenses|Where you sleep during the day. Affects how likely you are to someday get a knock on your door.|
|"Core" game structure|Preparing for and running heists using D&D ability and skill checks, with combat sometimes breaking out.|

# Location- and Campaign-Specific Rules Sheets

I hope your brain is already storming after those examples of loops, but there's one more awesome feature that comes from the __downtime days and lifestyle expenses__: they are both _tightly_ bound to the specific locations of your campaign, and different locations in your campaign can have unique sets of activities. This enables you and your players to really bring out the local flavor of each location, and in turn your entire campaign world.

Any time your players become interested in staying at a hamlet they're travelling through, establish friendly relations with the goblin village that you intended to be a speedbump, or irritatingly decide to take over your villain's rather nice lair, the only prep you need to do for your next week, and potentially the rest of your campaign, is come up with some unique activities and write a single new **campaign-specific rules sheet** for the newly-important location. By the end of your campaign you'll have a binder full of these rules sheets, and both you and your players will feel confident in your collective ability to _really_ send the party anywhere in the campaign setting to do _whatever_ they want.

One of the big advantages of a shared campaign setting like Greyhawk or Faerûn is that your players can go home and look up info on their own, and start brainstorming for the next session without having to pepper you with questions. As you build up these permanent rules sheets and share them with your players, you're establishing the same kind of resource for your own campaign settings.

## Tonight's Menu
To get the most use out of these location-specific sheets, try thinking of them like a map of a theme park. Although describing a D&D campaign as a "theme park" is sometimes a derogatory remark, remember that a theme park map's purpose is to show you __basic amenities__ and __how to get to the rides__. Such maps only give you a tantalizing hint of how the ride itself is going to go once you get there: they're like a treasure map with a trail leading to an otherwise-unlabelled X. From another perspective, although a restaurant __menu__ lets you order food, you can't simply eat the pictures or descriptions, or read the menu and then go home satisfied.

You may get a better sense of my idea of a menu if you read the example rules for downtime activities available in the _Player's Handbook_ and contrast them with the random tables that are available in the _Dungeon Master's Guide_ or _Xanathar's Guide to Everything_ under "downtime activities":
- The _Player's Handbook_ rules, and your location-specific **menus**, help **the players** to understand _how to get to the ride_: how much it'll cost, how many days it might take, and what general kind of ability checks or encounters they can expect.
- **Random tables** such as those in the _Dungeon Master's Guide_ help you as **the DM** to come up with random events in-game _once the players are on a ride_. **Don't** put this kind of information in the public menu that you share with your players, although you're free to prepare it for yourself.
 
The "ride" part of this new kind of "theme park" campaign is the open-ended _adventuring_ session, where you and the players improv new situations based on the starting conditions generated by your menu, using the [flexible new core at the heart of 5th edition's ability checks](5e_ability_checks.md#top).

## The Times They Are A-Changin'
You can also make new menus depending on the outcomes of campaign events. If your players establish a thieves' guild in your personal campaign setting's usual starting-town, you can create a new version of your setting-standard menu to show the new possibilities in the town.

Imagine you're prepping a campaign with a long-term story involving a city-state preparing for and then fighting an extended war. You could prep multiple versions of the city's menu for different stages of the story: one menu for the initial peaceful state, one or two stages of the city's military preparations, a menu for living in the city under martial law, and finally one menu for activities in the city while it's under active seige. The different versions of the menu can have different activities, lifestyle expenses, movement speeds, city laws, and anything else you can think of.

What if your players want to visit the echo planes for a particular location? The Shadowfell can have a variant menu: is the echo of your hometown a dark and grim variant of the existing city, or is it a ruin? In the Faewild, is there a vibrant fae city, or dangerous, utterly untamed, wilderness? The Border Ethereal, Deep Ethereal, and the Astral Plane may not merit a full menu, but activities such as burglary or even trade could involve them. Will using _Etherealness_ too much draw attention from Phase Spiders, or worse? Do Far Realm aberrations wander the Astral Plane, looking for distant movement like a raptor? And can a character reduce the danger with increased lifestyle expenses?

# Welcome to Port Nyanzaru
Tomb of Annihilation's Port Nyanzaru was my first one of these location-specific rules sheets, and I plan on writing _many_ more in the years to come. Initially I was just fleshing out "basic" downtime day activities such as working, carousing, buying items, etc, but the real magic began when I started injecting specific details of Port Nyanzaru into the activities: the creative writing of the flavor of Port Nyanzaru and the mechanical board-game-style rules of the activities began to feed into and deepen each other in an _extremely_ cool way.

Here's the sheet in it's current state so that you can see what I mean: [Activities in Port Nyanzaru](../tomb_of_annihilation/player_notes/activities_in_Port_Nyanzaru.md#top). Read or skim through it, and think about how you would narratively handle selling loot or letting characters train in new skills in your current campaign's home-base-town, and how the rules and activities you'll write will be utterly different from my personal Port Nyanzaru.

Thank you for reading, and I hope you have a blast writing campaign settings and playing D&D!
