# Initiative
**New Skill Proficiency: _Initiative_**. Used for initiative rolls and little else. A newly-created character may swap any one of their skill proficiencies for _Initiative_. The _Alert_ feat is unchanged.

Initiative rolls are generally **Dexterity** ability checks with the newly available **Initiative** skill proficiency. A character might use a different ability or skill proficiency depending on what they were doing when initiative was rolled:

> D&D 5e removed actions such as _Refocus_ and _Delay_, and made initiative a single unchangeable roll at the start of each combat.
>
> WotC's goal, as a company producing a mass-market product, was to avoid having to nail down complicated edge conditions around spells that end at "the end of your next turn". Overall, I think this simplification was the right move, and fortuitously the resulting system is a clean and simple foundation for DMs to write homebrew rules on top of.
>
> Individual DMs and players are of course free to ad-hoc actions similar to _Refocus_ or _Delay_ and duct-tape their way through the consequences whenever the mood strikes them.
