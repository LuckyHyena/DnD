# Characters

A character may choose options from the following 5th Edition _Dungeons & Dragons_ sources:

1. The _**Player's Handbook**_
2. _**Xanathar's Guide to Everything**_
3. One other official WotC sourcebook

> _**The Adventurer's League**_ only allows the _Player's Handbook_ and one other official WotC sourcebook; many people choose _Xanathar's_ as their second sourcebook.

> The [_Basic Rules_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules) and the [_5th Edition System Reference Document_](https://5thsrd.org/) are free resources for players without a _Player's Handbook_; they contain a subset of the PHB's options.

I might approve _Unearthed Arcana_ and non-WotC options.


# Ability Scores

Determine a character's starting ability scores with one of the following two methods:

either the _**Standard Array**_

1. Assign the six numbers 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8, to the six ability scores in whatever order you desire.

or the _**Dungeon Master's Favorite**_

2. Roll each ability score **in order** by rolling 4d6 and adding the three highest d6 results together. When you are done generating all of the character's scores, perform **exactly one swap** of two ability scores of your choice. Reminding me that you used this method may result in your character getting _Inspiration_. Thank you to [DM David](https://dmdavid.com/tag/organized-play-versus-random-ability-scores/) for describing this method.

> **The Adventurer's League** is extremely discriminatory when considering candidate adventurer characters: unless your character is one of those lucky few who happen to have born under an astrological configuration that blessed them with a set of abilities that fits the **standard array**, they have no hope of entering the esteemed League, unless we choose to simply, and calmly, update their abilities when you come to the session.
> 
> Additionally, characters must maintain the discipline to spend their _entire careers_ choosing the **fixed hit points per level** described within in the 5e _Player's Handbook_. It's no surprise that only a tiny number of candidates survive each year's winnowing process to be allowed into the League's ranks.

# Hit Points
You should roll your hit points when you level up, cowards. Live a little! You may take the full hit points for your first level as normal.

# Gaining Levels
Advancing in levels is determined by a character's **Experience Chunks**, which are otherwise identical to the so-called experience "checkpoints" described on _Xanathar's Guide_ page 173. 

> They are therefore also valid for trade in the markets of _**The Adventurer's League**_.

While a character is lower than 5th level (tier 1), they require **four** Experience Chunks in order to level up. From level 5 onward, a character needs **eight** Experience Chunks per level instead.

Characters may level up at the **end** of any long rest.

# Feats
Characters may select feats to replace ability score improvements they get from leveling up. Humans may take the variant human feature described in the PHB.

> _**The Adventurer's League**_ tolerates feats, although characters who choose feats are expected to work harder and accomplish greater things, to prove they have earned them.

Every character may take a single bonus feat at 1st level, unless they are in _**The Adventurer's League**_.

# Trinkets
Remember that new characters roll on the _Trinkets_ table on PHB pages 160-161! Let me know about your character's trinket!

![immovable rod](../images/immovable-rod.jpg)

### Optional Rules

> **_The Adventurer's League_** has zero tolerance for optional or homebrew rules, a policy which their powerful Bureaucrats enforce in each and every game with a merciless (and truly terrifying) efficiency.

# Diagonals
The optional _Diagonals_ rule on DMG page 252 is in play: every other diagonal movement consumes 2 squares of a character's movement instead of 1.

Thus, moving one square diagonally consumes `1 square` of your character's movement, moving two squares diagonally on the grid consumes `3 squares` of movement, three squares consumes `4 squares`, four squares consume `6 squares`, and so on.

# _Dungeon Master's Guide_ Combat Actions
All the _Action Options_ on DMG pages 271-272 are generally available for use:

- climb onto a bigger creature
- disarm
- mark
- overrun
- shove aside
- tumble

A reminder of some of the less-common combat actions from the PHB:
- help another character with an attack roll or an ability check
- make a Wisdom (Perception) ability check
- grapple
- shove

# Inspiration
Players have my permission to award _Inspiration_ to each others' characters.

Characters start each session with _Inspiration_, and I'll try to award _Inspiration_ when I notice you:
1. take a risk or make a suboptimal choice because of one of your character's traits or flaws.
1. remember that you already have _Inspiration_, and use it.

Generally, you must declare that you're using _Inspiration_ _**before**_ the dice are rolled. You may receive a "reroll" _Inspiration_ as a form of extra-inspired _Inspiration_.

# Downtime Days and Lifestyle Expenses
See [downtime activities in Port Nyanzaru](../tomb_of_annihilation/player_notes/activities_in_Port_Nyanzaru.md#top) for some examples of downtime activities.

### The Homebrew

# Fumbles
An ability check result of **less than 5** or a **Natural 1** on the d20 roll is a _fumble_, which sometimes has an effect.

I don't do fumbles on attack rolls or saving throws.

# Assisting Another Character for Advantage
When you assist another character to give them advantage, you each separately make your own roll, using your own ability scores and proficiencies, and the higher of the two rolls is used to make a single check.

# Random Encounters
See [rules for random encounters in Tomb of Annihilation](../tomb_of_annihilation/player_notes/rules_for_random_encounters.md#top) for an example of how I'll handle random encounters.
