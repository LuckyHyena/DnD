__Ford:__

> This was the very question that consumed Arnold, filled him with guilt, eventually drove him mad.
> 
> The answer always seemed obvious to me. There is no threshold that makes us greater than the sum of our parts, no inflection point at which we become fully alive. We can't define consciousness because consciousness does not exist.
> 
> Humans fancy that there's something special about the way we perceive the world, and yet we live in _loops_, as tight and as closed as the hosts do, seldom questioning our choices, content, for the most part, to be told what to do next.
> 
> No, _my friend, you're not missing anything at all_.

> 
> So _I changed it_.

> One _ring_ to rule them all, one _ring_ to find them,
> 
> One _ring_ to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
> 
> In the land of Mordor where _the shadows lie_.
