While we are telling a story about roleplaying, to **influence** the creatures in another party, one character and one optional assistant may an ability check based on the type of the creatures they're influencing. Generally, you must roleplay further to make additional checks.

*Depending on the creature and its hostility, party characters may be forced to make Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throws during roleplaying, or else suffer the effects of these powerful, and alien, minds manipulating and toying with the character.
