# Rules for long rests in Chult

### Long Rests
It's most common to take a long rest either in a town or city, or at a campsite the party sets up for the evening.

A long rest is at least 8 hours of time, during which characters can't engage in any strenuous activity.

While the party takes any long rest they gain the following benefits:
- At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points.
- The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to **half** of the character's total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.
- If a character has any levels of _exhaustion_ they may remove one level, provided they have eaten their full day's requirement of food and water during the previous day.
- Any character with enough Experience Chunks may level up.

All benefits are gained at the end of the long rest, or at dawn if the party is camping overnight.

A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

### Without a campsite
If the party is taking the long rest in a dungeon or other unsafe area, **5 Random Encounter Checks** will be rolled. All rest benefits will accrue regardless of encounters unless the party abandons the rest due to an encounter.

At the end of a long rest without a campsite each of the characters may perform one of the [short rest activities](activities_for_short_rests.md#top).

### Travelling in the jungle
Use the [rules for camping in Chult](rules_for_camping.md#top).

> **_Highly Optional_ Hardcore Variant:** For a darker and grittier campaign setting, we could use the _Alternative Rests_ rule in the DMG, and make it so that short rests require 8 hours of rest, while a long rest requires 1 entire week of avoiding strenuous activity and adventuring.
