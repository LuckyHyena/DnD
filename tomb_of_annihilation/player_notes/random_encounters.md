# Random Encounter Checks
To check for a random encounter someone at the table will make an aptly-named **Random Encounter Check**:
1. Roll a plain _**d20**_.
1. If the face on the die is **equal to or greater than** the party's *Random Encounter AC* then something will be encountered.
1. The DM will describe what.

--- 
> ## THE PARTY'S **RANDOM ENCOUNTER AC** IS _**SIXTEEN (`16`)**_
> _The random encounters for this adventure are brought to you by the number `16`!_
---

Advantage is flipped since the party is the "defender" being "attacked" by the encounter: if the party has advantage roll two d20s and choose the lower die, and vice versa for disadvantage.

# Encounter Distance
### In the Jungles of Chult
To determine the distance at which two parties spot each other in the wilderness, every character rolls a **Wisdom** (Perception) ability check. The highest check in each party is used. The distance at which each party spots the other is a multiplier of the former's check, assuming neither party is trying to be stealthy.

> A _spyglass_ can be purchased for 100 platinum coins in the Jewel Market of Port Nyanzaru. It doubles the distance at which things can be spotted, except in heavy rain or tropical storms. A _magnifying glass_ can be purchased for 10 platinum coins, but won't help you here.

| terrain and weather | distance | easy [10] | hard [20] | nearly impossible [30] |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|anywhere with **heavy rain**|disadvantaged Wisdom check result * 10 ft (2 squares)|100 ft|200 ft|300 ft|
|jungle, river, or swamp|Wisdom check result * 10 ft (2 squares)|100 ft|200 ft|300 ft|
|coast, mountain, plateau, or wasteland|Wisdom check result * 30 ft (6 squares)|300 ft|600 ft|900 ft|
|lake or sea with **light rain**|Wisdom check result * 250 ft (50 squares)|2500 ft|5000 ft or ~1 mi|7500 ft|
|lake or sea with clear skies|Wisdom check result * 0.5 miles|5 miles|7.5 miles|10 miles|

Characters doing [downtime activities while the party is travelling](jungle_activities.md#top) cannot roll to spot other parties.

# Enemy Morale and Behavior

Enemies reduced to half or fewer hit points are **bloodied**. A _bloodied_ enemy continues to fight but prioritizes self-preservation over maximizing damage output: a _bloodied_ enemy might start taking defensive actions, switch to ranged weapons, or focus on supporting its allies. Other creatures can see that the enemy has shifted its behavior, and therefore that it is _bloodied_.

A force of enemies **routs** when at least half of the enemies, weighed by Challenge Rating, have been downed. _Routed_ enemies all switch to self-preservation and usually flee.

If an enemy force has one or more **leader or boss creatures**, and the players defeat all such creatures, the remaining enemies instead rout when at least half of their original strength has been **either downed _or_ bloodied**. If the boss creatures supply a lot of the enemy force's Challenge Rating it's quite possible for their death to immediately rout the remaining enemies.

Creatures such as golems or undead that are immune to the *frightened* condition might hold their ground but are still visibly _bloodied_ or _routed_.

> **Character Bonus:** Undead _turned_ by a **holy cleric or paladin** behave as though they are a _frighten_-able creature that has been _bloodied_, and when half or more of their Challenge Rating has been _turned_ or destroyed the entire force is _turned_ and _routs_.

_not the same rules as DMG page 273_

## Playing with the tension of random character death

---

# Permanent Injuries
When a character receives a __permanent injury__ they will receive a penalty such as one of the ones on the _Lingering Injuries_ table on DMG page 272, or a result from one of the _Dungeon Crawl Classics_ critical hit tables.

Long rests and effects that heal hit points are insufficient to treat these permanent injuries.

---

# Critical Hits
A player character who is struck by a critical hit may choose to either take __the damage__, or suffer __one permanent injury__ instead.

---

# Dying
When a player character drops to 0 hit points:
- They have a **50% chance** of suffering one **permanent injury**.
 - **All other effects still apply:** The character falls _unconscious_, is _dying_, and begins making death saving throws.
  
When a _dying_ character fails three _death saving throws_ before achieving three death-saving-throw successes:
 - The character has a **90% chance** of suffering another permanent injury.
 - The character remains _unconscious_ and _dying_ at 0 hit points, and **resets** both their death saving throw failures and their successes.
 - If not injured, then the character has a separately-rolled **10% chance** of **_actually dying_**.

---

# Fumbles
When a creature fumbles an attack roll **their turn immediately ends**, and they suffer one additional effect:

---

|d6|Fumble|Effect
|-|-|-|
|1|Shook|The creature is *__incapacitated__* until the **end** of their next turn: they can't take _actions_ or _reactions_.|
|2|Agony|The creature is *__poisoned__* until the **end** of their next turn: they suffer disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.|
|3|Dazzled|The creature is *__blind__* until the **end** of their next turn: attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.|
|4|Butterfingers|The creature throws their main weapon **1d4 squares** in a random direction.|
|5|Tripping|The creature falls __*prone*__ and is forced 1 square in a random direction. Forced movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.|
|6|Confused|The creature makes a single new attack roll against their closest potential target, friend or foe. If multiple targets are equally close one of them is chosen randomly. If the creature can't reach their target, they use their remaining movement speed to try to move into reach.|

---

# Climactic battles
In addition to random encounters, in D&D there are "scripted encounters", or "story missions", which both the party and the DM have spent a lot of time planning and preparing for, and which finally culminate in one or more **climactic battles**, during which:
- A character with three-failed-death-saves has a **100% chance** of suffering a coin-flip of __*either* actually dying *or* gaining a permanent injury.__

---

> Some ways besides death saving throws that player characters can still die:
> - Massive instant damage
> - 6 levels of _exhaustion_
> - Diseases or poisons
> - Accumulating a silly number of permanent injuries.
> - Doing something truly and obviously dumb despite being repeatedly warned.

---

_The reason I am making 5e's rules technically even less-lethal than they already are, and spelling out the previous section on morale, is so that I can get away with siccing way harder monsters on you. Random rolls also make the tradeoffs of combat decisions less predictable and more interesting, as well as tempting players to not save each other (since a dying character_ "probably won't die"). _As a consequence the correct random rolls can add drama to the game, but my_ **primary** _reason for all this is to use cooler monsters. Just FYI._
