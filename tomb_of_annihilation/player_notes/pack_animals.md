### Tomb of Annihilation
# Pack Animals and Carrying Capacity

__ONE STONE__ is fifteen pounds. One stone is also the weight of a single **day's food and water rations** (two pounds of food and two gallons of water) for a medium or small character in Chult, and these rations are the main thing you **must** have carrying capacity for. Make your choices with an eye to how many guaranteed safe days in the jungle each option gets your party: 50 stone of carrying capacity can support a party of five characters for a tenday [without foraging](travelling.md#foraging-food-and-water).

Every creature has a carrying capacity, and if a creature tries to carry more than its capacity it will suffer penalties. A creature can drag up to twice its carrying capacity, but if party members or their pack animals are _dragging_ the party is limited to moving at a slow pace on the hex map.

# Vehicles

Instead of dragging, a creature can pull or power a vehicle. A __vehicle__ multiplies the carrying capacity of its __pack animal__ by 5, and this is the cheapest way to get carrying capacity.

All the vehicles listed here can support (and multiply the carrying capacity of) either **one or two pack animals per vehicle**, and they can all carry up to **six medium or small characters as passengers** that don't count against carrying capacity. The party may not use more than two vehicles at a time.

A vehicle has its own weight, which must be carried by its pack animals. Vehicles don't have their own carrying capacity, and all carrying capacity is provided by the pack animals.

## Canoe
With a canoe the party can travel at an [increased speed](travelling.md#paces) along rivers, marshes, and coasts, but anywhere else the canoe must be carried. The party may use a canoe without a pack animal: the canoe multiplies the party's carrying capacity by five.

# Animal Handling
If the party is travelling with pack animals, each day the party must make a WIS ability check using Animal Handling against their most difficult pack animal's DC. If they fail, the party is reduced to slow pace for the day.

The party may **hire animal handlers** in Port Nyanzaru, in which case the party automatically passes the daily check. Skilled handlers cost 2 gold coins per day. High DC animals require multiple handlers, while animals with a DC of 9 or lower can be handled by unskilled workers who only cost 2 silver coins per day.

> For simplicity of gameplay all animals forage for themselves and all hirelings carry or find their own food and water.

# Human Resources
If it becomes relevant (and it shouldn't) medium characters weigh stone equal to their CON score (average ten stone) and small characters weigh a third of that, unless players specify otherwise.

If you don't want a pack animal (???) or are desperate for capacity, each party member has a carrying capacity equal to their STR score, or an average of ten stone per character.

For the non-armor parts of a character's equipment, add at least one stone for any item that weighs 13 pounds or more. All the rest of the equipment (the 12-lbs-or-lighter stuff) together weigh a single additional stone, unless you're doing something ridiculous like carrying more than one 10-foot pole (7 pounds each).

|Armor|Weight|
|-|-|
|Leather, Hide, or Padded|0 stone|
|Studded Leather, Chain Shirt, Breastplate|1 stone|
|Scale Mail, Half Plate, Ring Mail|3 stone|
|Chain Mail, Splint, Plate|4 stone|

![immovable rod](/images/immovable-rod.jpg)

A nonpurchaseable _Bag of Holding_ can hold 33 stone of weight, but the _Bag_ itself never weighs more than one stone.
