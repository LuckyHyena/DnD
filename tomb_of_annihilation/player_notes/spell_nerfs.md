##### Tomb of Annihilation
# Spell Nerfs

The following spells are harder to cast in Chult than normal, due to the _Tarrasque_:

|Name|Spell Level|Note|
|-|-|-|
|[Create or Destroy Water](http://5thsrd.org/spellcasting/spells/create_or_destroy_water/)|4|-|
|[Goodberry](http://5thsrd.org/spellcasting/spells/goodberry/)|4|3rd level for Rangers|
|[Create Food and Water](http://5thsrd.org/spellcasting/spells/create_food_and_water/)|6|4th level for Paladins|

Spells with "At Higher Levels" effects are adjusted appropriately.

Druids of the [Circle of the Land](https://5thsrd.org/character/classes/druid/#circle-of-the-land) with a desert focus get _Create or Destroy Water_ for their circle spell instead of _Create Food and Water_.
