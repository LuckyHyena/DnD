# Rules for camping in Chult

[Summary of these rules](camping.md#top)

### The Nightly Schedule
Generally, characters can't travel for more than 8 hours per day without risking becoming _exhausted_. The remaining 8 hours in the day left after travelling and resting are consumed by:
- Any random encounters
- Finding a campsite
- Setting up camp
- Cooking supper
- Evening activities such as talking, reading, or gaming
- Taking a shift on the night watch
- Making breakfast
- Morning activities such as talking, physical training, or personal morning rituals
- Feeding and taking care of pack animals, if any
- Breaking camp

The following rules empower you to simulate and experience these nightly hours of drudgery alongside your character.

# Let's go camping
The very first step each evening is one that still uses _**Survival**_ instead of the new [_Camping_](character_creation.md#camping). Finding a **safe** campsite that avoids common animal trails and is protected against nightly ambush is not a mere creature comfort.

Every day that the party travels, one character may choose to spend their time **searching for a good campsite**. That character makes a **Wisdom** (**Survival**) ability check, generally of the same difficulty that it takes to navigate in the local terrain, and the check result becomes the starting value of the newly-discovered campsite's **Camp Goodness**. Camp Goodness is an abstract measurement of how good the campsite is, useful for using in game mechanics.

Unless I'm tired, the DM will randomly determine one **special feature** of the new campsite, and describe it.

Generally only one other character may assist in searching for the campsite, and they provide advantage to the first character's check. If the party is unsatisfied with their initial campsite then another character, along with an optional assistant, may make **another Wisdom check** to find a second campsite. The party may continue seeking out new campsites until they come to a decision: the final choice may be made from **any of the found campsites**, regardless of how early or late they were found.

Searching for the campsite is a liminal activity that takes place late at the end of the travel portion of the day and the start of the camping portion of the day. Any character that participates in searching for the campground suffers disadvantage on their rolls for activities **later in the evening**. If the character did an activity **earlier in the day** they suffer disadvantage on their Wisdom check to search for the campsite.

##### Initial campsites
|Initial Camp Goodness|Difficulty to Find|Description|
|-------------|------------------|-----------|
|0|Fumble|That's bad.|
|5|Very Easy|Unsheltered in bad weather. Rocky ground with nowhere to sleep, cook, or eat comfortably.|
|10|Easy|Loud and irritating background noise all night. A position close to a known trail or traffic.|
|15|Moderate|A defensible position after a little re-arranging. Good shelter from the elements.|
|20|Hard|A secure position to defend from. Tasty wild spices are found nearby.|
|25|Very Hard|A secure position on a high ridge with clear visibility, including of a nearby herd of game animals.|
|30|Nearly Impossible|The party stumbles across an abandoned _Mordenkainen’s Magnificent Mansion_ near a popular watering hole for wild game.|

> _sometimes people complain that D&D settings don't take into account just how much magic would be used to solve practical problems in the world. anyways, you might be surprised at the number of abandoned_ Mordenkainen’s Magnificent Mansions _there are out there_

# Morning Chores
Each character may do a [morning activity](camping_activities.md#morning-activities), or a [short rest activity](short_rest_activities.md#top)

### Settling in for the evening
After the camp has been found, the party sets up camp and characters may begin doing [evening _Camping_ activities](camping_activities.md#camping-activities).

# The Night Watch

The night's random encounter will be determined with a single Random Encounter Check. A d20 is rolled, and if the face number is equal to or higher than the Random Encounter Number (usually 16), something is encountered.

If the party is taking their **long rest** inside a dungeon or in some other clearly-unsafe area, **3 Random Encounter Checks** will be rolled during the rest. All rest benefits still accrue if there are random encounters.

### The bump in the night
Unless you guys care about watch order I'm just gonna randomly roll to select a single character at random who's awake on watch when the night's encounter happens.

> Any and all of these mechanics assume that the DM expects simulating how the encounter starts will be worth the hassle.

### Sound the alarm
Any character that is awake and **watching the perimeter** makes a **Wisdom** (**Perception**) ability check, and the best one is used. The particular encounter determines the difficulty of the check and what happens after it, but many encounters have a standard set of general outcomes that depend on how low the party rolled:

|Check Result|Difficulty|Status|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|Below 5 or a Natural 1|Fumble|No alarm|Every party member is _surprised_ including the characters watching the perimeter.|
|5|Very Easy|Late alarm|Characters who aren't watching the perimeter are _surprised_ for the first round of combat.|
|10|Easy|Slow alarm|Sleeping characters are _surprised_ unless they beat a moderate difficulty with a Wisdom saving throw. If they fumble the saving throw another character must shake them awake as an action before they may roll initiative.
|15|Moderate|Alarm|No party members are _surprised_ but characters that were sleeping must still grab their equipment.|
|20|Hard|Early alarm|Everyone in the party is awake and fully equipped except for their armor.|
|25|Very Hard|Early warning|Everyone in the party is awake and fully equipped, including armor. Players may reposition their characters on the battle map before initiative is rolled.|
|30|Nearly Impossible|Saw them coming from a long way off|The party can ambush the intruders, and if combat starts the other side is _surprised_ for the first turn.|

If the party wants to keep the fire safely going all night, then a second character will be awake, but **not paying attention** to the perimeter, along with the character on watch.

A party may keep two characters on each watch. If so, every character in the party gets less overall rest, and must make an Easy difficulty [DC 10] Constitution saving throw or else suffer a level of _exhaustion_.

### Sleeping Characters
Characters that **weren't already awake** when the alarm sounds must use actions on their turn to equip items that would normally be immediately available in combat. Each turn a character can **equip or un-equip one item for free**, and may spend their action to equip or un-equip a second one. Equipping most armors takes significantly longer than one action; see the PHB section on armor for details.

All of a character's standard equipment is assumed to be somewhere within the battlemap **square or hex they start the combat on**.

Characters that were asleep also begin combat in the _prone_ condition, and must spend half of their movement to stand up and end the condition.

> **Character Bonus: Indigestion or Stress** can keep a character from getting a good night's rest. If a character is having issues sleeping because of any condition, they must make an **easy difficulty** [DC 10] **Constitution** saving throw, or else they too will be awake but not paying attention to the perimeter.
>
> Characters awake because of a failed save are generally _poisoned_, or have another condition. They may make a new save at the start of each of their turns, and end the condition on a successful save.

> **Character Bonus: Perimeter Secured** If a character spent their evening _securing the perimeter_, they gain advantage on all initiative rolls that night. Additionally, the character may use their previously-rolled Wisdom (Survival) check result to **replace the die result of one d20** rolled during the night random encounter, including: d20 rolls made by that character, the rolls of other party members, and opponents' rolls. Finally, each time that initiative is rolled that night, that character gains _Inspiration_ if they don't already have it.

> **Character Bonus: Elves** need only four hours of meditation each night to get the equivalent of eight hours' sleep for a human. A player with an Elven character may choose to start any night random encounter with their character **awake and watching the perimeter**.
> 
> A **Half-Elf** character has a **50%** of being awake and watching the perimeter, provided the player desires it.

# The morning sun has vanquished the horrible night

At dawn characters complete their long rest, and may [heal and level up](long_rests.md#top).

![immovable rod](/images/immovable-rod.jpg)

# Morning Chores
Each character may do a [morning activity](camping_activities.md#morning-activities), or a [short rest activity](short_rest_activities.md#top)

![immovable rod](/images/immovable-rod.jpg)

# Reviewing the night
After completing all the activities and ability checks in the evening, and again after completing all the checks in the morning, the players state all their results and then tell a stroy about how the night went.

Characters' successes and failures might result in a consequence for another character's check. Failing to gather firewood makes it hard to keep the fire, and a poorly keep fire making cooking harder. Generally, these consequences are resolved by giving advantage and disadvantage on the influenced check.

After resolving interference between checks, all of the results are applied to the Camp Goodness to provide a single, final number that accurately describes, in a way that the characters' mere subjective experiences could never hope to capture or express, the objective _goodness_ of that night. 

|Final Camp Goodness|Difficulty|Status|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|Below 5|Fumble|Catastrophic|Somehow, the party has transmuted the decision to _take a long rest_ into a mistake.|
|5|Very Easy|Terrible|What noble adventurers you are, to endure all this in the journey to achieve your quest!|
|10|Easy|Bad|That was unpleasant but could still easily be worse.|
|15|Moderate|Squalid|You're camping in the wilderness, you can't expect that much.|
|20|Hard|Modest|A pleasant and restful night amidst your otherwise long and difficult quest.|
|25|Very Hard|Comfortable|The party could get used to living like this.|
|30|Nearly Impossible|Home|The party will miss this camp.|

#### Let's blow this joint
As it begins, so it ends: after the party leaves characters may clean up the campsite and cover their tracks.

Covering the campsite so it looks like undisturbed wilderness requires a traditional **Wisdom** (**Survival**) ability check, by up to one character and one optional assistant.

|Difficulty|Result|Description|
|-|-|-|
|Natural 1 or Below 5|Fumble|The party suffers disadvantage on the next morning's Random Encounter Check.|
|5|Very Easy|The characters involved in hiding tracks suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (_Survival_) ability checks they make the following day.|
|10|Easy|-|
|15|Moderate|The party gains advantage on the next morning's Random Encounter Check.|
|20|Hard|The party gains advantage for Random Encounter Checks on both the next morning and the next afternoon.|
|25|Very Hard|The party gains advantage for Random Encounter Checks

# Bonuses for the day
Finally, the accumulated Camp Goodness determines what benefits or penalties the party will face in the following travel day.

Roll a d%, add the Final Camp Goodness Score, and compare with the [Random Camping Bonus Payouts table](camping_bonus_payouts.md#top).
