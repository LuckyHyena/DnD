## Tomb of Annihilation
# Some potential rules for Encumbrance

### How to get Stoned

A **stone** is fifteen pounds of weight. Characters have a maximum carrying capacity of **one stone per point of Strength**. A character can push, drag, or lift up to twice their carrying capacity; while pushing or dragging weight beyond their carrying capacity a character is _encumbered_, and their speed drops to 5 feet.

A Faer√ªn gallon weighs seven pounds, therefore the daily needs of one character in Chult (one pound of food and two gallons of water) conveniently weighs precisely one stone.

Unless otherwise specified medium creatures weigh **10 stone** and small characters weigh **3 stone**.

### Travelling
If the party attempts to travel by land in Chult while any characters are _encumbered_, then the party **must move at a slow pace** but has only a 5% chance of making progress instead of 50%: each day roll a d20 and the party **only advances a hex on a natural 20**. If fewer than half of the characters in the party are _encumbered_ the party gains advantage on this roll.

Canoes have a maximum carrying capacity of **120 stone**, or enough to carry **six medium characters** with average Strength plus their full carrying capacity. Canoes and ships can't drag or pull more than their capacity and sink if overloaded.

### Fitting Thirty-Three Stone in One
Each character in the party begins Tomb of Annihilation with a _**Bag of Holding**_. This magical Bag weighs just one stone no matter how much is put into it, and it can contain up to **thirty-three stone** of items.

It takes an action to **store or retrieve one item** from a character's Bag of Holding, and armor inside a Bag of Holding requires the full don time to equip.

All other items a character is holding count against their carrying capacity, including worn clothing, worn armor, weapons, and shields. These items are, however, immediately available for use when initiative is rolled.

Characters can survive inside a Bag of Holding, although they will eventually run out of air. Characters must not attempt to stack two Bags of Holding.
