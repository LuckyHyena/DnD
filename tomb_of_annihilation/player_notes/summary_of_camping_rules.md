# Summary of rules for camping in the jungles of Chult

### The Nightly Schedule
Generally, characters can't travel for more than 8 hours per day without risking becoming _exhausted_. The remaining 8 hours of your day left after travelling and resting are consumed by:
- Any random encounters
- Finding a campsite
- Setting up camp
- Cooking supper
- Evening activities such as talking, reading, or gaming
- Taking a shift on the night watch
- Making breakfast
- Morning activities such as talking, physical training, or personal morning rituals
- Feeding and taking care of pack animals, if any
- Breaking camp

The following rules empower you to simulate and experience these nightly hours of chores alongside your character.

# New Skill Proficiency: _**Camping**_ (Intelligence)
Characters can do advanced camp activities involved in camping in the wilderness using a new skill proficiency available to them called _**Camping**_. _Camping_ is usually applied to Intelligence checks, but other ability checks are often involved in _Camping_.

All adventurers have the option of selecting _Camping_ to replace one of their starting skill proficiencies.

> Camping does not replace and only occasionally overlaps with _Survival_: _Survival_ is about **safely** travelling through the wilderness and avoiding the many dangers and risks found in the wild; _Camping_ is about making a campsite more **comfortable** for a party of characters to rest in. The knowledge from _Survival_ (or _Nature_) can sometimes provide an advantage on a camping task, but neither includes the specific practical knowledge of _Camping_.

|Ability|Two Example Uses|
|-------|----------------|
|Strength|Chop firewood when the party has run out.|
|Dexterity|Manipulate meat on a grill. Set up a shelter with rope and tarps.|
|Constitution|Survive underdone cooking. Endure irritating noise from the environment.|
|**Intelligence**|**Figure out tasty and safe recipes from available ingredients. Think of a way to rearrange the camp to be more comfortable.**|
|Wisdom|Notice that an ingredient has gone bad. Control a campfire's flame by rearranging the wood.|
|Charisma|Keep a lively conversation going around the campfire. Talk shop with explorers or others who spend their time in the wilderness.|

# The Camping Loop

To complete the long rest that the party does at the end of a day of travel, execute the following algorithm.

The purpose of the algorithm is to establish and then update a Camp Goodness property of the campsite. At the end of the long rest, the party receives benefits or penalties for the following day based upon their final Camp Goodness score.

1. **Search for a campsite**
   1. One character and one optional assistant must roll a **Wisdom** (_Survival_) ability check to find a campsite and establish its initial Camp Goodness.
   2. The party may make further searches if they are unhappy with the first site. They may make their final decision from among any of the campsites found that day, regardless of the order they were found.
2. **Evening**
   1. Characters may [choose to do camping chores](activities_for_camping.md#evening-activities) to improve the Camp Goodness score, or they may do any [short rest activity](activities_for_short_rests.md#short-rest-activities) for buffs or healing.
   2. Generally, each character's chore or activity is resolved by rolling a single ability check.
3. **The Night Watch**
   1. A single Random Encounter Check is rolled for the night.
   2. If something is encountered, one random character from the party is selected be on watch at the time the encounter happens. Other characters might be awake as well.
   3. **The Alarm:** Any characters awake and watching the perimeter make a **Wisdom** (_Perception_) ability check to detect the encounter. Their result will determine which members of the party are _surprised_ if combat starts.
   4. **The Random Encounter** will be described by the DM.
5. **Dawn**
   1. The morning sun has vanquished the horrible night.
   1. Characters have completed their long rest, and may now recover health and/or level up. The long rest is successful even if there was a random encounter, unless the party completely broke camp in the night.
4. **Morning**
   1. Characters may do a [final round of chores](activities_for_camping.md#morning-activities) around the camp to improve the final Camp Goodness score, or do a [final short rest activity](activities_for_short_rests.md#top) before starting the day.
   2. Generally, each character's chore or activity is resolved by rolling a single ability check.
6. **Hit the road!**
   1. Calculate the final Camp Goodness score, and roll for a bonus on the [_Camp Bonuses Payouts_ table](random_camping_bonus_payouts.md#top).
   2. Begin [the jungling loop](rules_for_travelling.md#top) to complete the day's travel through the jungle.
