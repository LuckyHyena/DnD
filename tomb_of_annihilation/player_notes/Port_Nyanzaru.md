## Seven facts about Port Nyanzaru

1. Port Nyanzaru was a major trade hub for the nation of Amn until nine years ago, when the city's native merchant princes organized together and seized control of the city back from the foreign conquerer. Today a council of seven merchant princes rules over Port Nyanzaru, with each prince having a monopoly on certain kinds of trade.

2. A wide variety of dyes can be produced from materials in Chult, and Chultans dye both their clothes and buildings in bright colors. The city walls and guard towers are topped with colorful awnings to protect guards against the sun and rain.

3. Dinosaurs are used as beasts of burden throughout the city. Every tenth-day major streets are cleared for the immensely popular dinosaur races.

4. Port Nyanzaru is built to handle Chult's heavy rainfall and citizens ignore all but the worst storms. Rain catchers and waterwheels are visible on many buildings to make productive use of the rain. Immense rain gutters run along every street to prevent flooding.

5. Flowers and green plants sprout out of every crack and seam of Nyanzaru's stone streets and buildings. Nyanzaru's residents must manage the plants to prevent damage to the city's structures, and a few abandoned buildings are collapsing under creeping vines and moss.

6. A gargantuan dragon turtle called [Aremag](dramatis_personae.md#aremag) patrols the Bay of Chult and demands treasure from ships that pass through while going to or from Port Nyanzaru. Although a drag on trade, many citizens of Port Nyanzaru have become fond of Aremag as a symbol of the city. The covetous beast is indifferent, and largely unaware of the concerns of the city.

7. In addition to trade from the Trackless Sea and the Shining Sea, the economy of Port Nyanzaru is based on mining, cutting lumber, hunting, and gathering rare materials from the jungle. Laborers living in hamlets and work camps in the jungle are in constant danger of being forced out by the undead and other dangers.

## Districts and Locations in Port Nyanzaru

### Harbor Ward
The harbor ward includes the extensive, and labyrinthine, cargo docks where ships load and unload trade goods, as well as the vast warehouses where those goods are stored. Port Nyanzaru is equipped to dock and deal with ships of any size, and traffic is constant during the day. Like many warehouse districts, at night the area is mostly abandoned and a fine place to meet in secret.

- An immense statue in the center of the harbor shows the ancient Chultan king [Na N'buso](dramatis_personae.md#na-nbuso) in full regalia.
- The harbor lighthouse.
- Fort Nyanzaru: guards the harbor entrance.
- The Royal Docks: restricted for the use of the merchant princes and their preferred guests.
- Dry docks for repairing ships.

### Merchants' Ward
Port Nyanzaru's upper classes reside in the opulent merchants' ward. This area hosts the finest shops and the biggest market in the city during the day, while at night anyone trying to travel or do business in the district must submit to questioning by the numerous [Zhentarim](dramatis_personae.md#the-zhentarim) guard patrols.

- The mansions of the [merchant princes](list_of_items_available_for_purchase_in_Port_Nyanzaru.md#top).

### Old City
The original Chultan city of Nyanzaru, which Amn conquered and expanded into the modern Port Nyanzaru. This section that was left outside the city walls has become a lower-class but still-respectable part of the city where many laborers live.

- The Beggars' Palaces: two massive stone ziggurats now crowded with newer construction.
- [The Executioner's Run](activities_in_Port_Nyanzaru.md#port-nyanzaru-the-executioners-run): a rectangular pit where criminals are sentenced to death via dinosaur. Visitors from all over the city come to watch.

### Malar's Throat
People with nowhere else to go in Port Nyanzaru are eventually forced into Malar's Throat, the slum district outside the city walls.

Two deep, jungle-covered ridges flank a ravine filled with trash, which floods during heavy rains. Ramshackle housing is crammed into every available space on the ridges. Rope and bamboo bridges up to 200 feet long hang between them, allowing passage over the ravine. Pickpockets wait on the hanging bridges and use fishing lines to steal from victims.

- Temple of Tymora, goddess of good fortune.

### Tiryki Anchorage
A less-developed area outside the city walls, the Tiryki (tee-REE-kee) anchorage is home to "animal trainers, river folk, and other rough-and-tumble sorts", whatever that means. It's also where most of Port Nyanzaru's dinosaurs are kept in pens, either to rest after a day of working or in preparation for slaughter. Unlike Old City or Malar's Throat, there are no stone buildings to take shelter in outside the city walls: running for the Tiryki Gate is residents' only option when undead or other dangers come out of the jungle.

- Less developed (and less patrolled) docks are preferred by smugglers.
- Vast pens of dinosaurs, and many teams of dinosaur trainers, all under the authority of merchant prince [Ifan Talro'a](list_of_items_available_for_purchase_in_Port_Nyanzaru.md#ifan-talroa).
