# Short Rest Activities

During a [short rest](short_rests.md#top), and at the very end of (most) long rests, each character in the party may optionally choose a method to relax and recover. The character makes an ability check based on the method they've chosen, and if they pass a **Moderate difficulty** they receive the bonus described in the table.

If a character rolling an ability check rolls a **Natural 1**, or their result fails to beat a **Very Easy difficulty**, then the character _fumbles_ and suffers the described setback.

> Any player who tells a story about their character's rest receives _Inspiration_ for that character, regardless of whether they make a check, or its result.

Any temporary hitpoints gained from these activities last until they are lost, or the character's next short or long rest.
