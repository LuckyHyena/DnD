# Short Rest Activities

During a [short rest](rules_for_short_rests.md#top), and at the very end of long rests, each character in the party may optionally choose a method to relax and recover. The character makes an ability check based on the method they've chosen. If they pass a **Moderate difficulty** then they also receive the bonus described in the table.

If a character rolling an ability check rolls a **Natural 1**, or their result fails to beat an **Easy difficulty**, then the character _fumbles_ and suffers the described setback.

> Any player who tells a story about their character's rest receives _Inspiration_ for that character, regardless of whether they make a check, or its result.
