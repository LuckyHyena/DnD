# Camping Activities
Each time the party takes a long rest while camping they may complete two rounds of chore activities to improve the camp: one in the evening before they rest and potentially face a random encounter, and another in the morning after they've completed both.

In either the evening or the morning, a character may opt instead to perform a [short rest activity](activities_for_short_rests.md#top)

Most chores involve an ability check with the new [_Camping_](character_creation.md#camping) skill proficiency, after which the Camp Goodness is modified according to the value of the check result, as shown below:

|Check Result|Difficulty|Change in Camp Goodness|
|-|-|-|
|Below 5 or a *Natural 1*|Fumble|- 1d12|
|5|Very Easy|- 1d6|
|10|Easy|- 1d3|
|15|Moderate|_no change_|
|20|Hard|+ 1d3|
|25|Very Hard|+ 1d6|
|30|Almost Impossible|+ 1d12|

# Evening Chores to affect Camp Goodness
|Chore|Maximum Characters|Ability Check|Skill Proficiency|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Cook|1 and 1 assistant|Int or Wis|_Camping_|__Very Important__: Double the change in Camp Goodness because of your check, or suffer -1d20 Camp Goodness if no-one cooks. __Difficult__: -5 to the check result.|
|Keep the Fire|1|Dex or Wis|_Camping_|The cook gains advantage this evening if you beat a Hard difficulty check, or suffers disadvantage if you fail an Easy difficulty (or if no-one tends the fire). __Important__: -1d6 Camp Goodness if no-one keeps the fire.|
|Set Up Camp|-|Str or Dex|_Camping_|__Important__: -1d6 Camp Goodness if no-one focuses on setting up camp, and subtract 1d4 - 1 from the party's Random Encounter Armor Class for the night.|
|Improve the party's spirits|2 and 2 assistants|Charisma|_Camping_ or _Perform_|-|
|Carouse|-|Constitution|_saving throw_|Roll a d4 for each of your character levels, and if your saving throw fails to beat a Moderate difficulty divide each of your rolls in half. Every carousing character gains temporary hit points equal to the sum of all the carousing d4s. __Annoying__: While determining the change in Camp Goodness, your saving throw result is considered ten lower than the actual result.|

# Other Evening Chores
|Chore|Maximum Characters|Ability Check|Skill Proficiency|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Cut and Gather Firewood|1 and 1 assistant|Strength|_Camping_|The fire-keeper suffers disadvantage tonight and tomorrow morning if you fail an Easy difficulty check (or no-one gathers firewood), or gains advantage if you beat a Hard difficulty check.|

# Morning Chores to affect Camp Goodness

Morning activities include:

|Chore|Maximum Characters|Ability Check|Skill Proficiency|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Cook|1 and 1 assisting|Int or Wis|_Camping_|__Very Important__: Double the change in Camp Goodness because of your check, or suffer -1d20 Camp Goodness if no-one cooks. __Difficult__: -5 to the check result.|
|Keep the Fire|1|Dex or Wis|_Camping_|The cook gains advantage this morning if you beat a Hard difficulty check, or suffers disadvantage if you fail an Easy difficulty (or if no-one tends the fire). __Important__: -1d6 final Camp Goodness if no-one keeps the fire in the morning.|

|Brew Coffee or Tea|1*|Wis or Cha|_Camping_|-|
|Improve Morale|2 and 2 assistants|Charisma|_Camping_ or _Perform_|-|
|Carouse|-|Constitution|_saving throw_|Roll a d4 for each of your character levels, and if your saving throw fails to beat a Moderate difficulty divide each of your rolls in half. Every carousing character gains temporary hit points equal to the sum of all the carousing d4s. __Annoying__: While determining the change in Camp Goodness, your saving throw result is considered ten lower than the actual result.|

*Multiple characters may brew coffee, tea, or similar breakfast drinks in the morning. They do not provide each other advantage but instead brew separate pots and then argue over which one is the best. Regardless of their opinions, only the objectively-highest check result counts for affecting Camp Goodness.
