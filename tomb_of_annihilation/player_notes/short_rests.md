# Short Rests
It's most common to take a short rest in a dungeon, when characters need to recover health but don't want to or can't afford to take the time to do a long rest.

A short rest takes 1 hour of time, during which characters can't engage in any strenuous or extensive activity.

While a party takes a short rest:
- One **Random Encounter Check** will be rolled. All rest benefits still accrue regardless of whether something is encountered, but after the encounter.
- Each character may optionally perform one [short rest activity](short_rest_activities.md#short-rest-activities) by performing an ability check.
- A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level.
  - For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total.
  - The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.
- If resting after a battle, any character that expended weapon ammunition during that battle may roll a d100 and recover that % of their expended ammunition.

> **Character Bonus:** A few classes, particularly the Warlock but also the Wizard, have class abilities that can be recovered during short rests. These are generally rare, and most classes require long rests to recover their spells and abilities, or anything beyond health.
