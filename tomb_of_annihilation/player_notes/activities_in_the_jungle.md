# Rules for downtime activities in the jungle

![Chultan Jungle](images/undead-trex.jpg)

While the party is travelling around Chult, a character may optionally choose to pursue one of the following downtime activities while relying on other members of the party to navigate. Any character doing a downtime activity while the party is exploring is distracted, and suffers the following penalties:

- Disadvantage on **all saving throws** for the day.
- Disadvantage on **initiative rolls** during random encounters.
- Disadvantage on **the first ability check of each random encounter**.
- Cannot [roll to spot random encounters](rules_for_random_encounters.md#encounter-distance).

See [downtime activities in Port Nyanzaru](activities_in_Port_Nyanzaru.md#retraining) for more details on each activity.

## Investigating
If your investigation involves reading, studying physical objects, or you can tell some other story about investigating in the jungle, you may prepay the daily 1 gold coin fee for investigating in order to bring research materials out of Port Nyanzaru and study them while following the rest of the party. Each downtime day you finish investigating 1 gold coin's worth of the research materials, and when you have finished all of the prepaid materials you are unable to make further progress.

## Training with a skill or tool
If you can tell a story about training in the jungle with a particular skill or tool, then your character can prepay the daily 1 gold coin training fee in order to bring training materials out of Port Nyanzaru. A character consumes 1 gold coin's worth of training material each downtime day they spend training.

## Learning a language
You may prepay the daily 1 gold coin fee in order to carry materials for studying a new language. For every downtime day you spend studying while exploring you finish 1 gold coin's worth of the material, and when you have finished all of the material you can no longer increase your language proficiency.

## Retraining
You may spend ten downtime days to reselect any number of options in your class features, or to reselect a single ability score advancement/feat. 1 gold coin magically vanishes from your pocket each day, but it doesn't have to be prepaid in Port Nyanzaru.

## Teaching another character
You may assist another character who is studying a skill, tool, or language, provided you are fully proficient in it yourself. You can assist a character who is retraining class features if you share at least one of those class features, or any character who is retraining ability scores/feats.

The student you teach makes progress twice as fast and consumes twice as much material per day.

## Catching up
A party member that is lower level than at least half the other characters may spend their time shadowing the other members of the party, who share stories and point out and explain things they've learned from their more advanced adventuring experience.

For every __fifteen__ downtime days a character invests in catching up, they gain __one Experience Chunk__.

A character with enough Experience Chunks can level up as part of any long rest.

A character that is catching up suffers the normal penalties for being distracted, except they **don't suffer disadvantage on saving throws**.
