##### Tomb of Annihilation
# Quick Random Encounters for Travelling

These encounter rules are designed to resolve random encounters without running the full 5e combat rules. Most of these encounters are either **very easy or very hard**: the rules give too-easy encounters a chance to cause meaningful attrition, but also let the party flee from the consequences of too-hard encounters.

#### Travelling Hit Dice
While travelling each character has a number of __Hit Dice__ equal to their best hit die's max roll divided in half, plus their CON modifier.
- At the end of a long rest a character rolls 1d4, adds their CON modifier to the result, and recovers that many hit dice. A character always recovers a minimum of one hit die at the end of a long rest.
- At the end of a short rest, a character recovers hit die equal to their CON bonus, or a character may roll an easy CON ability check to recover a single hit die.

> A bard (d8) with no CON modifier has 4 hit dice total, recovers 1d4 dice at the end of a long rest, and may recover a single hit die if they successfully make a CON ability check of easy difficulty at the end of a short rest.
> 
> A barbarian (d12) with a +2 CON bonus has 8 hit dice total, recovers 1d4 + 2 dice at the end of a long rest, and 2 dice at the end of a short rest.

#### Temporary Hit Dice
> If a character gains temporary hit points from [short rest](../tomb_of_annihilation/player_notes/short_rest_activities.md#top) or similar activities, each time they accumulate their best hit die's max result in temp hp they gain a temporary hit die that can be sacrificed before a real one. These temporary hit points and dice don't expire while travelling but can accumulate over time.

#### At Higher Tiers

As the party advances in tier characters gain more travelling hit dice:

|Tier|Bonus|
|-|-|
|2|+2 hit dice|
|3|+4 hit dice|
|4|+6 hit dice|

## Running Quick Encounters

To start the random encounter a WIS (_Perception_) check will be rolled to determine how early the party __Spots__ the encounter. The check is based on who was [watching for enemies](../tomb_of_annihilation/player_notes/travelling.md#travel-activities) while the party was travelling.

If the spot check result beats a moderate difficulty all party members get advantage on the first round of the encounter. If the check _fumbles_ every party member suffers disadvantage for the first round of the encounter.

#### Round and Round and Round
Each random encounter consists of at least three things: a number of __Rounds__, a __Difficulty__, and a number of __Consequence Dice__ that will be rolled at the end of each round. The following Ras Nsi Cannibals are a simple example:

---

### Ras Nsi Cannibals (Human, Hunter)
Two rounds of moderate difficulty:
> The party rolls 3d6 and loses that many hit dice.

---

For each round, every party member may attempt a single ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that makes sense for the encounter. Every roll that beats the round's difficulty reduces the number of consequence dice by one. After all party members have made their attempts, any remaining consequence dice are rolled and the party suffers based on the result.

#### Losing Hit Dice
If the party loses hit dice, they decide which characters lose hit dice and how many each loses. If a character runs out of hit dice to lose they may suffer a level of exhaustion to replace losing a hit die.

#### Hiding/Sneaking
If the party has advantage from their Spot check, or if they're travelling at a slow pace, they may try to hide from or sneak past the encounter before it begins. Characters may roll ability checks with _Stealth_ (without advantage) and if they beat a moderate difficulty subtract a single consequence die from the first round. If the party successfully prevents all consequence dice for the first round they have successfully evaded the entire encounter.

#### Fleeing
Characters can and should attempt to flee by rolling an appropriate DEX ability check. If they beat a moderate difficulty they are out of the encounter and can no longer contribute or suffer consequences. A character that has successfully fled can provide advantage to a single fleeing character in each subsequent round, or they may rejoin the encounter and lose their flee success.

If all party members successfully flee they escape any remaining rounds and consequences.

## Example Encounters

### Ras Nsi Zombie Horde (Undead, Hunter)
Easy to hide and flee from.

Unknown rounds of moderate difficulty:
> The party rolls 3d6 and loses that many hit dice.
>
> **Unending Hordes:** For each consequence die rolled, one random party member must make a CON saving throw or gain a level of _exhaustion_.

---

### Zombie T-Rex (Undead, Hunter)
Easy to spot.

Four rounds of very hard difficulty:

> The party rolls 6d6 and loses that many hit dice.
> 
> **Disgorged Hordes**: For each consequence die rolled, one party member must make a CON saving throw or gain a level of _exhaustion_.

---

### Stuck! (Natural, Trap)
_One random character has gotten stuck in dangerous terrain or a constructed trap._

Hard to spot. No hiding or fleeing.

Three rounds of moderate difficulty:
> Roll 3d4. The trapped character gains levels of _exhaustion_ equal to the sum divided by four.

---

### Water Crossing (Environment)

The party may choose to go around this Environment hex, and they can't spot, hide, or flee from it.

One round of moderate difficulty. If the party has a canoe, party members get a +5 on their checks.

> The party rolls 4d6 and loses that many hit dice.
>
> For each consequence die rolled, a random character is exposed to disease.
