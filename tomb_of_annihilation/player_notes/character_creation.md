# Tomb of Annihilation

Welcome to _Dungeons & Dragons_!

When playing D&D you'll be creating and using a **player character**, one member of a party of adventurers who are **working together to complete a quest**. Although D&D characters can get into quite a strange variety of adventures, _generally_ adventuring involves travelling into uncivilized wilderness, exploring ruins and dungeons, and fighting monsters. Your character should be one who's prepared to fight and to adventure: generally, all the standard character classes have the skills and equipment you need.

Additionally, your character **shouldn't** be one who's unable to work cooperatively with other people, such as a thief who tries to steal or hide treasure from the rest of the party, or someone who starts fights with the other player characters.



### My Character Creation Rules

# Character Options

A character may choose options from the following 5th Edition _Dungeons & Dragons_ sources:

1. The _**Player's Handbook**_.
2. _**Xanathar's Guide to Everything**_.
3. One other official WotC sourcebook, including but not limited to:
   1. _**Tomb of Annihilation**_, this adventure. ([Options listed below](#tomb-of-annihilation-character-options)).
   2. _**The Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide**_, aka the 5th edition forgotten realms campaign setting.

> The [_Basic Rules_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules) and the [_5th Edition System Reference Document_](https://5thsrd.org/) are free resources for players without a _Player's Handbook_; they contain a subset of the PHB's options.

I might approve _Unearthed Arcana_ and non-WotC options, and will probably approve any "variant" optional rule for characters found in one of the three sources listed above.

# Ability Scores

Determine a character's starting ability scores with one of the following two methods:

either the _**Standard Array**_

1. Assign the six numbers 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8, to the six ability scores in whatever order you desire.

or the _**Dungeon Master's Favorite**_

2. Roll each ability score **in order** by rolling 4d6 and adding the three highest d6 results together. When you are done generating all of the character's scores, perform **exactly one swap** of two ability scores of your choice. Reminding me that you used this method may result in your character getting _Inspiration_. Thank you to [DM David](https://dmdavid.com/tag/organized-play-versus-random-ability-scores/) for describing this method.

> **The Adventurer's League** is extremely discriminatory when considering candidate adventurer characters: only those lucky few who happen to have be born under an astrological configuration that blessed them with a set of abilities that fits the **standard array** even have a chance of entering the esteemed League.
> 
> Additionally, characters must maintain the discipline to spend their _entire careers_ choosing the **fixed hit points per level** described within in the 5e _Player's Handbook_. It's no surprise that only a tiny number of candidates survive each year's winnowing process to be allowed into the League's ranks.
>
> Oh, also, they definitely have very different rules from the ones above about what sources a character may take options from.

# Hit Points
You should roll your hit points when you level up, cowards. Live a little! You may take the full hit points for your first level as normal.

# Gaining Levels
Advancing in levels is determined by a character's **Experience Chunks**, which are otherwise identical to the so-called experience "checkpoints" described on _Xanathar's Guide_ page 173.

While a character is lower than 5th level (tier 1), they require **4** Experience Chunks in order to level up.

From level 5 onwards, a character needs **8** Experience Chunks per level instead.

Characters may level up at the **end** of any long rest.

# Feats
Characters may select feats to replace ability score improvements they get from leveling up. Humans may take the variant human feature described in the PHB.

# Starting Equipment and Wealth
A character's starting equipment is the accumulation of all the following:
- The equipment listed for the character's **class**.
- The equipment listed for the character's **background**.
- If you have a _Player's Handbook_, you may roll for coins based on the **Starting Wealth by Class** table on page 143 of the _Player's Handbook_.
  - You may also roll for one random **TRINKET!**  
- A single _Potion of Healing_:
  - **Heals 2d4+2 hit points**.
  - A character must **spend their action** on their turn to chug the entire potion or administer it to another character.
- Syndra Silvane has given each member of the party **5 platinum coins** to begin the adventure.

# Trinkets
Remember that all 5e characters get to roll on the _Trinkets_ table on PHB pages 160-161! If you don't have a _Player's Handbook_ we'll let you roll at the first session. Let me know about your character's trinket, or lack thereof!

### Further information

##### New Skill Proficiency:
# _**Camping**_ 
### Commonly Intelligence or Wisdom
Characters can do [advanced activities while camping](summary_of_camping_rules.md#top) in the jungle using a new skill proficiency available to them called _**Camping**_. _Camping_ is usually applied to Intelligence or Wisdom checks, but other ability checks are often involved in _Camping_ as well.

> **All adventurers** have the option of selecting _Camping_ to replace one of their starting skill proficiencies.

See the [list of camping activities](activities_for_camping.md#top)

|Ability|Two Example Uses|
|-------|----------------|
|Strength|Chop firewood. Dig and rearrange the campground to be more comfortable.|
|Dexterity|Manipulate meat on a grill. Set up a shelter with rope and tarps.|
|Constitution|Survive underdone cooking. Endure bugs or irritating background noise.|
|**Intelligence**|**Figure out tasty and safe recipes from available ingredients. Think of a way to rearrange the camp to be more comfortable.**|
|**Wisdom**|**Notice that an ingredient has gone bad. Control a campfire's flame by rearranging the wood.**|
|Charisma|Keep a lively conversation going around the campfire. Talk shop with explorers or others who spend their time in the wilderness.|

> Camping does not replace and only occasionally overlaps with _Survival_: _Survival_ is about **safely** travelling through the wilderness and avoiding the many dangers and risks found in the wild; _Camping_ is about making a campsite more **comfortable** for a party of characters to rest in. The knowledge from _Survival_ (or _Nature_) can sometimes provide an advantage on a camping task, but neither includes the specific practical knowledge of _Camping_. The _Survival_ expert's answer to "how do we rest here" is "get over yourself and hunker down and bear it".

##### New Skill Proficiency: 
# _**Riding**_
### Commonly Dexterity
Riding a dinosaur at top speed, in the midst of dozens of other huge beasts in what is essentially a stampede, is a far more physical and strenuous activity than simply "handling" one. The [dinosaur racers of Port Nyanzaru](activities_in_Port_Nyanzaru.md#dinosaur-racing) use a new skill proficiency available to characters called _**Riding**_. A character's _Riding_ proficiency is usually applied to a **Dexterity** check, but racing involves all of a character's abilities at one point or another.

> **Character Bonus:** During character creation any character who is, or has the option to be, proficient in _Animal Handling_ may select _Riding_ to replace one of their skill proficiencies.
 
|Ability|Two Example Tasks|
|-|-|
|Strength|Pull the reins on a massive triceratops. Dig your heels into a dinosaur's thick feathers and hide.|
|**Dexterity**|**Dodge swinging tails and horns. Direct your mount with the reins.**|
|Constitution|Endure a strike by a dinosaur limb. Endure the rough ride, noise, smell, dust, and kicked-up debris of a race.|
|Intelligence|Predict that your mount will be spooked by something up ahead. Diagnose and treat a dinosaur when it's unhealthy.|
|Wisdom|Notice a subtle change in the stampede around you. Notice when a dinosaur or rider is hurt or becoming tired.|
|Charisma|Impress the crowd. Get a favor from another rider.|

Similarly to tools, characters are separately proficient with different species of rideable mount.

When managing a mount in combat, a character may use their proficiency bonus if they are _proficient_ in either _Riding_ or _Animal Handling_.

> **Character Bonus:** A character [training](activities_in_Port_Nyanzaru.md#training-with-a-skill-or-tool) in _Riding_ who is _proficient_ in **Animal Handling** can make a **Wisdom** (Animal Handling) check and subtract that many downtime days from the required number of days to reach the next level of _Riding_. Characters may do this once when they start training in _Riding_ and again each time they gain a +1 bonus from training.
>
> If a character rolls high enough to reduce the required days below one, then the character has revealed a natural talent for working with that kind of animal, and immediately gains the +1 bonus. The overflow days are then subtracted from the next level's requirement along with the results of the next Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.

---

##### New Skill Proficiency:
# _**Sailing**_
### Commonly Dexterity or Intelligence
Joining a [pirate-hunting crew](activities_in_Port_Nyanzaru.md#hunting-pirates) and sailing out of Port Nyanzaru during downtime uses a new skill proficiency available to characters called _**Sailing**_. A character's _Sailing_ proficiency is most often applied to **Dexterity** or **Intelligence** checks, but when the seas get rough other ability checks involving _Sailing_ are needed as well.

> **Character Bonus:** Any character with the _Sailor_ background, or any sea-related background, gains a bonus proficiency in _Sailing_.

|Ability|Two Example Tasks|
|-|-|
|Strength|Move the ship's cannons into position and aim and fire them. Quickly raise the anchor.|
|**Dexterity**|**Manage the ship's sails and rigging. Quickly climb to the crow's nest.**|
|Constitution|Resist waves sweeping over the deck. Avoid seasickness from terrible weather.|
|**Intelligence**|**Read charts and navigate using the sky. Figure out the best way to rig the sails.**|
|Wisdom|Detect a coming change in the weather. Spot a rare and dangerous feature of the sea.|
|Charisma|Work smoothly with other crew members during a crisis. Raise the crew's spirits.|

Characters sailing an unfamiliar ship require some time to adjust to their new vessel, but characters don't have to establish a separate proficiency for separate types of ships.
