## Tomb of Annihilation
# DM Notes: Distant Thunder

The **Tarrasque's Anger** begins at 5, and may increase or decrease over the course of the campaign. You should also keep track of the direction the Tarrasque is currently moving in.

# While the Party is in the Jungle
Every day the party travels on the Chult hex map, roll a d20. If the result is equal to or less than the Tarrasque's Anger, select a new random direction and the Tarrasque moves one hex in that direction. Otherwise, the Tarrasque moves one hex in the same direction it previously moved.

# While the Party is in Port Nyanzaru
Every tenday the party spends in Port Nyanzaru, roll a d20 and subtract the Tarrasque's Anger, then move the Tarrasque that many hexes in a random direction.

# Effects of the Tarrasque
