Thanks to the [Ironclaw RPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/82132/IRONCLAW-Omnibus-Squaring-the-Circle) for their excellent chase rules.

Running Chases
================

The targets running away are _quarries_, and the characters running after the quarries are the _pursuers_. Other characters that might interfere with the chase, either purposefully or on accident, are _interlopers_.

> If there are multiple quarries it's common for them to split up: keep track of each separated group of quarries separately, and each pursuer or interloper must choose one quarry or group to chase.

Within one chase, if there are multiple quarries then each pursuer chooses a single quarry to chase, and is given a __distance__ to their target, based on the starting conditions of the chase. Each round the characters each take a turn, and generally make an ability check to improve their situation: each pursuer is trying to reduce their distance to their quarry, while the quarry is trying to 

Chase Loop
===========

1. Start the loop:
    1. Everyone rolls initiative
    1. As each quarry takes their first turn, they decide if they're following another quarry or splitting off on their own.
    1. As each pursuer takes their first turn, they decide which quarry they're chasing.
1. Each round:
    1. Roll a random Chase Obstacle that affects all chase characters.
    1. Each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of their turn, or else suffer disadvantage on all rolls until the beginning of their next turn.
        1. The difficulty begins at 10 and increases by 2 at the end of every round.
    1. Each character takes a turn
    1. If one or more pursuers reach distance 0 to their quarry, they successfully catch their target.

# Catching your quarry


Official jumping rules
======================

[SRD](https://5thsrd.org/adventuring/movement/)

>> ## Jumping
>> Your Strength determines how far you can jump.
>>
>> ## Long Jump
>> When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.
>>
>> This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.
>>
>> When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.
>>
>> ## High Jump
>> When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.
>>
>> You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1 1/2 times your height.
