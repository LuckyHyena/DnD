To select a random location for the Soulmonger at the start of the campaign, or a random location for a different encounter, roll a d16 and do the following based on your roll:

- 1-15: Find the blue number that you rolled, and the cluster of numbers adjacent to it. Roll a d20 and choose that numbered hex in the cluster.

- 16: Roll a d20 and choose the blue-numbered hex with that number.
