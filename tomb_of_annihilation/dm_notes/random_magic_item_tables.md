# Random magic items for Port Nyanzaru markets

Players may assume that all the items in these lists are pre-approved for being specifically hunted in Port Nyanzaru markets. However, the reason most of them are pre-approved is because they are neither powerful nor particularly useful, so you probably wouldn't bother.
